         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E ſhould not be ignorant of the wiles and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of Satan,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 2.11.</note> who being a lyar and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer from the beginning,<note place="margin">Joh. 8.44.</note> hath made it his perpetuall practiſe by lies to ſeeke the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of ſoules. His lies are of two ſorts; one ſort whereby he indevours to perſwade men to embrace falſhood as truth, to call evill good, and ſwallow down deadly poyſon as wholeſome food. The other, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he labours to perſwade men to reiect truth as falſhood, and call good evill, that ſo mens ſoules may be famiſhed for want of neceſſary nouriſhment. This he doth in matters of eſtate, practiſe, faith, and worſhip; and the more errour he can entangle us in, the ſtronger hold he hath of us. His principall endeavour therefore is to keep us in diſlike and deteſtation of all good, and love and delight in all evill. If he cannot prevaile ſo farre, he labours at leaſt to intangle the ſoule in one or two dangerous errours, that will bring certaine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. Many he detaineth in ſottiſh ignorance, groſſe profaneneſſe, and heatheniſh impiety; perſwading them that their eſtate, practiſe, faith, and worſhip is good enough, ſo that they can ſay, God is mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull; Chriſt died for ſinners; they profeſſe the true religion, and plead that all forwardneſſe in religion, which exceeds their lazie ſtraine, is but curious preciſeneſſe, and needleſſe now fangled ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laritie.
<pb facs="tcp:111961:4"/> Thus he prevailed with many, (to the grievous ſcandall of religion, and danger of their own ſoules) even in the Apoſtles times, as may appeare by the lamentable profanneſſe, errour, and ignorance in ſome Churches,<note place="margin">See 1 Cor. Chap. 5. &amp; 6.8. &amp; 10. &amp; 15. &amp; 2 Ep. &amp;c. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> eſpecially that of the <hi>Corinthians.</hi> If he cannot thus prevaile with ſome who leave their ſinfull courſes, and deſire in all things to pleaſe God, and to make their calling and election ſure; and in maters of faith, worſhip, and practiſe, to be guided by the truth; he will raiſe in them ſcruples that they may ever be queſtioning Gods love unto them, the truth of their grace, and the ſoundneſſe of their religion: ſo farre as to hold them downe with deſperate diſcouragements, and deepe perplexities, and cauſe them to denie Gods gratious worke in them. How many doth Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan in our dayes abuſe, by leading them to miſ-iudge of their eſtates? One partie ſitting ſecurely without queſtioning the condition of their ſoules in reſpect of God; as if all things were ſo well with them that they need nothing more. Another party on whom God hath ſhewed much mercy, yet ever doubting and queſtioning. So for matters of faith, practiſe, and worſhip; a great part is held in ſuch careleſneſſe that any religion will content them, that ſuites with their carnall ends, and they take up their religion without examining the grounds thereof. Others as much be abuſed on the other hand, who becauſe they ſee ſome things queſtioned and proved unſound that havs gone for currant: therefore will make bold not onely to queſtion, but alſo in their manner to declaime and diſpute againſt many lawfull, war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable, well grounded, yea, and neceſſary truths, and practiſes, taught, enioyned, or approved in the Scripture. As for example, the moralitie of the Sabbath, yea the uſe of the whole Morall Law, ſubiection to the civill Magiſtrate; the lawfulneſſe of an oath, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and communion in Gods worſhip, where all things are not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed punctually according to their humour; yea humane learning (and what not?) have been cried down as Antichriſtian. Amongſt the reſt the baptizing of infants of Chriſtian parents is condemned. Concerning which they doe not make ſober inquiſition, as deſirous to try all things, and hold faſt that which is good; but earneſtly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute, uſe vehement aſſeverations, and carry on the matter with ſo great confidence and boldneſſe, together with citation of many Scriptures, and pretence of ſincere love and zeale to the truth; that
<pb facs="tcp:111961:4"/> poſſibly the hearts of ſimple and upright Chriſtians may be troubled, if not enſnared; which hath been the ancient practiſe of Satan by his inſtruments, (whether they were ignorant of what they did, or knowing, I ſay not) <hi>Act. 15.</hi> See the magiſteriall peremptorineſſe of thoſe falſe teachers. And how apt Gods people are to be troubled with words, or writings of this kind appeareth. In the ſame place, <hi>Act. 15. verſ. 2. &amp; 2.4. &amp; 2 Theſſ. 2.2.</hi> Our darke mindes and corrupt wils being farre more prone to errour and vice, then to truth and vertue. And how Satan will beſtirre himſelfe by his inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and make uſe of the ignorance, pragmaticalneſſe, pride and malice of ſome men this way, we may ſee, <hi>Gal. 3.1, 2, 3.</hi> Which things I having had ſome experience of, and meeting with a Pamphlet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled, <hi>The vanitie of Childiſh Baptiſme, &amp;c.</hi> by <hi>A. R.</hi> and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that ſome are drawn away to admire and imbrace the opinions therein maintained, and that others were unſatisfied concerning ſome things that are therein delivered: I was troubled to ſee that ſuch ſtumbling blocks ſhould be laid before Gods people; but not ſeeing a ſpeedy remedie procured, by that ſo much wiſhed and prayed for way of a Synod of Gods faithfull Miniſters, to conſider of thoſe things that trouble the Church according to that example, <hi>Act. 15.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther having ſeene any thing purpoſely written upon this ſubiect; (Though of many the unfitteſt, in regard of want of abilitie, helps, and time, wherewith others abound) I inclined my thoughts to anſwer the maine Arguments that the Authour brings againſt the baptiſme of infants, and to vindicate our Arguments againſt the Obiections here made. Though I confeſſe, conſidering the groſſe and manifeſt errours, the fantaſticall conceits, the taunts, ſcoffes, and raylings, and evident abſurdities, wherewith the Booke is ſtuffed, (which ſhew with what a ſpirit the Authour was led) it may ſeeme unworthy an anſwer: yet becauſe there are ſome truths ſcattered therein, many Scriptures alledged, (though impudently perverted) and much zeale and confidence pretended; many iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious people may conceive there is ſome matter of weight and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in it. Therefore untill God ſhall be pleaſed to ſtirre up ſome fitter more fully to handle this ſubiect (if this controverſie be not rather to be buried in ſilence for the abſurdneſſe of the Adverſaries opinions) I have undertaken by the aſſiſtance of God and rule of the
<pb facs="tcp:111961:5"/> Scripture to examine this Authour. In which examination I will not follow him in his extravagancies, and impertinencies; neither ſhall I (I hope) imitate him in his bold and confident, yet ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe aſſertions; much leſſe in bitter taunts and reproachfull ſpeaches which he uſeth towards our Miniſters and Church: (If I ſometime ſet forth the ridiculouſneſſe and weakneſſe of his reaſoning; or retort on him his own language, to ſhew how much fitlier it agrees to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe then thoſe on whom he beſtowes it; I conceive I have warrant in Gods word, <hi>Prov. 26.5. 1 King. 18.27.</hi>) But in the feare and as in the preſence of God, I will make triall of his principall reaſons and grounds, ſo farre as God ſhall enable me by the light of his holy word; not intending to defend all the Arguments which he undertakes to anſwer; nor to reply to all his Anſwers of Obiections, whereof ſome (whether invented of himſelfe, or obiected by others) I owne not, ſeeing ſometime the truth may be pleaded for upon unſound grounds. The truth I ſtand for; not the weake grounds. But I hope that whatſoever he obiecteth with any ſhew of reaſon or weight I ſhall ſufficiently anſwer; and lay down grounds for the defending of the truth that may ſatisfie any intelligent Reader that ſeeks the truth: So I come to his <hi>Preface to the Reader.</hi>

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Neither you nor any one elſe hath found in thoſe Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, that onely actuall beleevers, and profeſſours of their faith ought to be baptized and none elſe. Where is I pray you the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle onely, or any thing equivalent thereto? None of thoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts or examples limite Baptiſme for all times onely to ſuch: Though ſuch as beleeved and profeſſed the faith be there ſpoken of; will it follow that none elſe have right to baptiſme? The Diſciples are neither forbidden to baptize others but profeſſours of the faith; nor limited to thoſe onely, for ought that can be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered from thoſe places. <hi>Abraham</hi> which firſt received the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:111961:6"/> ſeale of circumciſion,<note place="margin">Gen. 15.6. with Gen. 17.1, 2, 3, &amp;c.</note> and in his own perſon actually entred into Covenant with God, was endued with the righteouſneſſe of faith, having not as a meere patient, but as an agent accepted the Covenant. Will you thence inferre that onely ſuch ought to be circumciſed under the old Covenant, as had in their own perſons as agents accepted of Gods Covenant, and were endued with the righteouſneſſe of faith,<note place="margin">Gen. 17.10, 11.</note> whereof they were to make profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion? the Text will confute that inference. Yet your collection is no better from ſome examples of perſons of ripe yeers which were out of the new Covenant before, and were now to be brought under it. Who becauſe they muſt beleeve, and profeſſe their faith before they were baptized; therefore their children though borne of parents within covenant, may not be baptized untill they actually beleeve and profeſſe their faith. For as upon <hi>Abrahams</hi> beleeving and receiving the Covenant, and ſeale of circumciſion, his family was received into covenant, and all his males circumciſed: ſo we have plaine examples in the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament of Governours of families, who beleeving and being ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized, had their whole families baptized alſo; where yet there is no word of the faith and profeſſion of any beſides the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, as <hi>Act.</hi> 16.15. &amp; 31.32, 33. 1 Cor. 1.16. as ſhall be ſhewed more fully hereafter, God willing, in due place.</p>

                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> Though I will not go about to defend every expreſſion in the Liturgie, or the Authours brought by you: yet I may well deny, firſt, your propoſition as you expreſſe it: ſecondly, I deny alſo that the reaſons brought by you from the Liturgie, and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours prove that in our Church the end of baptizing is regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, ſo that the act of baptizing ſhould regenerate the child.</p>
                  <p>But to come to your propoſition. If your meaning be that the end of our baptizing is properly to regenerate; as if our Church uſed baptiſme that they may (<hi>ex opero operato,</hi> as the Papiſts ſay) conferre grace and regeneration, it is a ſlander to ſay it. If you meane that they uſe it for this end that it may be a pledge, ſigne, ſeale, or confirmation of regeneration; or to ſpeake brieflier, that we uſe it ſacramentally to regenerate, or myſtically to waſh away ſinne, we avouch it; and this we beleeve is the right end of baptiſme, as you grant, <hi>viz.</hi> A pledge of the pardon of ſinne, which implies regeneration, ſo <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.3, 4. <hi>Mar.</hi> 1.4. <hi>Act.</hi> 22. &amp;c.

And why may not the ſame be ſaid to regenerate us, as well as to ſave us? Is not regeneration the beginning and alſo part of our ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?

And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we may and ought to pray for the regeneration of infants to be baptized, (that if begun, it may be continued, increaſed, ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and perfected: if not, that it may be wrought in Gods due time; ſo that baptiſme may have its efficacie.)

                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> Will any man ſay, that all that were baptized by <hi>Peter,</hi> or to whom baptiſme was applied in his time (of which he ſaith,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 3.21.</note> that it ſaveth) were certainly ſaved? Or that it was an abſurd thing to preach regeneration or ſalvation after baptiſme? Or that this doctrine, that baptiſme ſaveth or burieth with Chriſt, &amp;c. is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with that other doctrine concerning the perſeverance of the Saints, ſeeing ſome of thoſe that were baptized in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles time fell away and periſhed? Or in your baptiſme (if you uſe any) which you profeſſe is a pledge of the remiſſion of ſinnes; are all certainly pardoned? Or need you never to preach repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and regeneration to them? If ſo, belike you are happier maſters to your diſciples, then Chriſt was to his.</p>
                  <p>And ſeeing now you thinke you have got our learned Divines (as you ſcoffingly call them) at an advantage, and follow them ſo eagerly with your horned argument, as if your blow were unavoidable, <q rend="inline">comparing your ſelfe to Chriſt, and them to the Scribes and Phariſees,</q> 
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 21.23. Let us try whether you would not by this Argument, baffle and nonplus the Prophets, Apoſtles, and Chriſt himſelfe. For this your Argument holds as ſtrongly againſt them as againſt us, who teach no other thing in ſaying that baptiſme regenerateth, and true grace can never be loſt (though ſome baptized periſh) then what we have received from Chriſt, the Prophets, and Apoſtles. Might you not as well have taken up <hi>Nathan</hi> for preaching unto <hi>David,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Sam. 12.</note> to bring him unto repentance and converſion. Why, what needs this <hi>Nathan? David</hi> received circumciſion the ſeale of the righteouſneſſe of faith, and of circumciſion of his heart in his infancie,<note place="margin">Rom. 4.11.</note> and had the ſpirituall grace beſtowed on him effectually; and muſt he now
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:111961:8"/> be regenerate and borne againe? And why ſhould <hi>David</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe upon <hi>Nathans</hi> exhortation and reproofe,<note place="margin">Pſal. 51.10.</note> pray that <hi>God would create in him a cleane heart, and renew a right ſpirit within him?</hi> (which, what elſe is it but the renewing of the worke of regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration?<note place="margin">Ezek. 18.21. Jer. 4.4.</note>) Why ſhould the Prophets exhort the Iews to make them new hearts, and circumciſe their hearts, though they had received circumciſion? What would <hi>Nathan, David,</hi> and the Prophets have anſwered this ſubtill diſputant if he had examined them thus?</p>
                  <p>Or if you had been living in <hi>Pauls</hi> time, when he called up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Romanes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 12.2. 2 Cor. 5.17. Epheſ. 4.23. &amp; 24. Gal. 4.19. Rom. 6.3. Gal. 3.27.</note> 
                     <hi>Corinthians, Epheſians</hi> and others, to repentance and renovation; to put off the old man, to put on the new man, to become new creatures, to be renewed in the ſpirit of their mind; profeſſing that he travelled to forme Chriſt in them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. Belike this learned Divine (to uſe your phraſe) <hi>Paul</hi> would ſoone have beene daſht, if you had but riſen againſt him. <q rend="inline">Why, what's the matter <hi>Paul?</hi> Did not you teach that ſo many as have beene baptized into Chriſt, have put on Chriſt, are buried with him in baptiſme? What? have they put off Chriſt? riſen againe to ſinne?<note place="margin">Rom. 8.38, 39. Phil. 1 6. Rom. 11.29.</note> fallen away from grace, &amp;c. This will not ſtand with your doctrine; that nothing ſhall ſeparate from Gods love; that God will perfect the good work which he hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun; that the gifts and callings of God are without repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. Therefore you were deceived in ſaying that Chriſt is put on in baptiſme; or in teaching that men cannot fall away from grace.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Or if you had had <hi>Peter</hi> in hand when he called <hi>Simon Magus</hi> to repentance, <hi>Act.</hi> 8, 22. though he had been baptized; you would belike have leſſoned <hi>Peter</hi> better. <q rend="inline">Why, what needs this <hi>Peter?</hi> Didſt not thou teach that baptiſme ſaveth, and is he that was ſaved even now damned againe?<note place="margin">1 Pet. 3.21.</note> ſure thou waſt miſtaken when thou ſaidſt baptiſme ſaveth; or when thou ſaidſt that the faithfull are preſerved by the power of God through faith unto ſalvation,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.5.</note> ſith <hi>Simon</hi> that awhile agoe beleeved and was bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, hath need now to repent, as being in the gall of bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and bond of iniquitie.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus if you had diſputed, learned <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> belike had beene in great ſtraits what to have anſwered. It was well for them that none of theſe acute Anabaptiſts (as they are called) were ſprung up in thoſe dayes. One more inſtance I will bring.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:111961:8"/> Our bleſſed Saviour preacheth unto his Diſciples neceſſitie of converſion, and becoming as little children,<note place="margin">Matth. 18.3.</note> as they would enter into the kingdome of heaven. Yet elſewhere he ſaith,<note place="margin">Joh. 3.35.</note> Except a a man be borne againe of water and the holy Ghoſt, he ſhall in no wiſe enter into the kingdome of God. Thereby (as you gather) aſſuring us that if a man be regenerate and borne againe, he ſhall ſee the kingdome of God. But I conceive you will not deny but the Diſcipcles had already beene borne againe by water and the holy Ghoſt. Sure in this caſe had you beene in his time you would have more troubled him with your <hi>Dilemma,</hi> then an hundred of the Scribes and Phariſees with all their Sophiſtrie. What? To teach that being borne againe by water and the holy Ghoſt,<note place="margin">Joh. 10.28.</note> they ſhall certainly enter into the kingdome of God: And that none ſhall pluck them out of his hands being given him of the Father: And yet now threaten them with the loſſe of the kingdome of heaven, unleſſe they ſhall be converted, become as little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren? (which, what elſe is it but to be regenerate?)</p>
                  <p>Doe you thinke that this your arguing would have perſwaded the world that Chriſt was a falſe witneſſe of God? When your reaſoning thus againſt the Prophets, Apoſtles, and Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, ſhall be found unanſwerable, we ſhall be forced to yeeld unto you; but untill then we (who in this point have their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine for our warrant; That though Baptiſme ſave and regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, yet baptized perſons have need to be called upon to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and regeneration) need not to regard your bold, and confident aſſeverations.</p>
                  <p>I have the largelier ſet forth the manner of your reaſoning, only changing the perſons, (if it may be) to make you ſee your weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; if not, to make others aſhamed of their ſimplicitie which admire ſuch diſputers. You would not have reaſoned ſo, if you had conſidered: Firſt, that notwithſtanding ſome abuſe baptiſme, yet that hinders not but in regard of Gods inſtitution, baptiſme may be ſaid to regenerate or ſave. And ſo ſecondly, that they which have received baptiſme according to Gods appointment, as farre as we can diſcerne, may be ſaid to be regenerated and ſaved, <hi>viz.</hi> ſacramentally. Thirdly, that baptiſme is adminiſtred to the members of the Church; not onely as a pledge of remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſinnes paſt, upon ſuppoſition of repentance and faith; but alſo of ſinnes to come; being both an obligation to us daily to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new our faith and repentance, and an aſſurance unto us, that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:111961:9"/> the performance of that condition God will pardon; in ſo much that our regeneration, <hi>viz.</hi> ſacramentall in baptiſme is a main ground, why Miniſters ſhould call upon us being baptized to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt our regeneration in our lives, ſeeing God hath given us the ſeale of regeneration to aſſure us of the grace it ſelfe, if the fault be not in our ſelves; and to bind us to repentance that we may be partakers of the remiſſion of ſinnes; and hence the Apoſtle urgeth converſion or ſanctification from baptiſme before recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.<note place="margin">Rom. 6.</note> So that if in Chriſts and the Apoſtles time the baptized had need to be called to repentance or regeneration, though baptiſme ſaved and buried with Chriſt: what abſurditie is it if our Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters call to repentance, and regeneration, thoſe that were rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated in baptiſme in the forenamed ſenſe? For even in the beſt times ſome that had profeſſed, and beene baptized, had done it unſoundly and hypocritically, and ſo had need to be called unto ſinceritie: whereunto when they were brought, their baptiſme though received in time of hypocriſie, ſhould be a pledge of the remiſſion of ſinnes;<note place="margin">Act. 8.</note> as in <hi>Simon Magus</hi> whom <hi>Peter</hi> bids to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, but not to be baptized againe. Secondly, others might have the truth of grace and regeneration, and yet not give ſo cleare te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie thereof to themſelves and others as was to be deſired. Thirdly, thoſe that had truely repented and beleeved, might have fallen and need to be reſtored. Fourthly, the beſt by ſuch exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations are kept watchfull. None in this life are ſo fully regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or converted, but they need additions and increaſe. So that your conſequences that you draw againſt us from our principles are frivolous.</p>

                     </label> Firſt, I would deſire to know, Whether the Baptiſme which you adminiſter regenerates and ſaves, or no. (I meane ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally, for we ſay ours regenerates) If no, then it is not the Baptiſme that Chriſt &amp; his Apoſtles uſed,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 3.</note> for <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, it ſaved;
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:111961:9"/> 
                     <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, it buried with Chriſt. If yea,<note place="margin">Rom. 6.</note> whether you beleeve that all that are baptized of you, are certainly regenerate and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, or no; and then tell us, what is the ground of your beliefe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Whereas you diſlike this diſtinction, you ſhould have demanded of <hi>Peter</hi> and other the Apoſtles and Evangeliſts (that baptized ſome hypocrites no doubt, witneſſe <hi>Simon Magus, Ananias, Saphira,</hi> &amp;c. and yet held that Baptiſme ſaveth and buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with Chriſt) whether they held that theſe who received Baptiſme were ſaved and buried with Chriſt in the judgement of certaintie or charitie, and then you might have demanded a ground of that their judgement: And ſeeing you arrogate to your ſelf ſuch skill in Scripture, tell us what was <hi>Peters</hi> ground in ſaying Baptiſme ſaveth, when yet many that were baptized were damned; and what anſwer you ſhall make to this queſtion, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly may ſerve to anſwer your own queſtion to us.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, We anſwer directly. Our ground on which we build this charitable opinion, (<hi>viz.</hi> that Baptiſme regenerateth ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally; or that infants of Chriſtian parents baptized are rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate) is Gods word. For doth not the Scripture tell us, that God is the God of the faithfull and of their ſeed, that he hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken them into Covenant?<note place="margin">Gen. 17.7.10.</note> Thus God promiſed unto <hi>Abraham</hi> the father of the faithfull, not as any priviledge peculiar unto him; but as the common priviledge of all in covenant, and therefore proſelytes of what nation ſoever upon their entring into cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant had their children taken into covenant likewiſe. Again,<note place="margin">Exod. 12.48. Act. 2.36. 1 Cor. 7.17.</note> the promiſe is made not onely to the faithfull, but alſo to their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. Hence it is, that the children of beleeving parents are holy. Which places of Scripture ſhall in due place (God willing) be vindicated from your groundleſſe exceptions. Now whoſoever is in covenant with God, hath God for his God, hath the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes belonging to him, and is holy, muſt needs be regenerate, as he is in covenant, hath God for his God, &amp;c. And therefore ſeeing that children are in the ſame condition with their parents (or thoſe that are in ſtead of their parents) in reſpect of outward covenant (which is all the ground we have for judging others;) So that if the parent be in covenant, the child remaines ſo untill by his own perſonall infidelitie and apoſtaſie he diſcovenant him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: if the parent be out of covenant, the child remaines ſo, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till by his own perſonall faith, he accept and enter into covenant. Hence it follows, if we have ſo much ground for our judgement
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:111961:10"/> of charitie, to hold that the parents are regenerate, as the Apoſtles had for thoſe whom they baptized, which was no more then their profeſſion of faith and repentance; we have the ſame ground for our judgement concerning the regeneration of their children. <hi>viz</hi> profeſſion of faith and repentance made by their parents; though we may oft be deceived in parents and children, and no marvell, even the Apoſtles themſelves were deceived: for they doubtleſſe baptized many hypocrites.</p>
                  <p>As for your other objections, whether fained by your ſelf and fathered on us, or found in any writings on our ſide; they are not worthy defending, nor your anſwer unto them worthy a reply. Who ſay, that The meere election of infants, whether all or ſome, is the ground of our baptizing them, or beleeving them to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate. If any ſay ſo, let him anſwer for himſelf. But our ground, as hath been ſhewed, is the externall being in covenant; whereby they have right to the ſeale of initiation; which is not without its efficacy unto al; though ſome (whether they receive it in infancy or ripeneſſe) by their own fault may render it unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to themſelves. Therefore your frivolous inferences have no place here, as that, <hi>Al men &amp; women in the world are to be baptized:</hi> for all are not outwardly in covenant. And as for your confident aſſertion, that Faith manifeſted by the confeſſion of the mouth, is the only ground of Baptiſme to the elect, (if you meane it of the profeſſion of faith of the perſon to be baptized) it is not proved by thoſe Scriptures you alledge,<note place="margin">Act. 8.37. Rom. 14.23.</note> (as hath been partly ſhewed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, and God willing ſhall be ſhewed more fully hereafter) unleſſe you will make the Eunuches Baptiſme with all its cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, a neceſſary rule to be followed by all to be baptized. So much may ſuffice to be anſwered to your firſt conſideration.</p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> We will try how ſubſtantiall this reaſon is. Whereas you ſay; The uſe of water muſt be either by infuſion or dipping: In ſome ſenſe this is true, namely, if it be taken by way of enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meration, not of oppoſition; for Baptiſme which ſignifies waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is done by applying the water to the party baptized or waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; But water is ordinarily applyed the one of theſe two wayes. <hi>viz.</hi> either by dipping or ſprinkling. In this ſenſe we grant your propoſition is true: <hi>viz.</hi> that Baptiſme muſt be either by dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping or infuſion, and ſo that it be either way it is ſufficient. But you take it not in this ſenſe, as may appeare by the manner of your reaſoning; for by the affirmation of the one, you inferre the deniall of the other; and if you ſhould take it in this ſenſe, it would make againſt your ſelfe, and overthrow your own argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Therefore it appears you take it by way of oppoſition, and ſo we utterly deny it as falſe. Your reaſoning is like this, We come to the knowledge of Chriſt by reading the Scriptures, or hearing the word preached.<note place="margin">Joh. 5.39.</note> But Chriſt bids the Iewes to ſearch the Scripture, <hi>viz.</hi> by reading, that they might come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of him. Therefore not by hearing the word preached. Or like this, The Miniſter muſt preach either ſitting or ſtanding. But Chriſt preached ſitting.<note place="margin">Matth. 5.1. &amp;c.</note> Therefore Miniſters may not preach ſtanding. Or this, We muſt pray either ſtanding, or kneeling, or ſitting, or lying, &amp;c. But Chriſt ſaith, when you ſtand praying.<note place="margin">Mark. 11.25.</note> Therefore it is not lawfull to pray with any other geſture but ſtanding. Who ſeeth not the weakneſſe of this reaſoning? yours is no better.</p>
                  <p>But to come to your aſſumption. <hi>But</hi> Iohn <hi>the Baptiſt or Dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per (as you ſay, according to the Dutch) did uſe the water: By put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the partie into the water, not by inſuſing or ſprinkling, Mat.</hi> 3.11. <hi>Mar.</hi> 1.8. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.26. <hi>Act.</hi> 11.16.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, Whereas you gather from the Originall: that <hi>Iohn
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:111961:11"/> baptized in the water,</hi> and dipped the whole man all over <hi>in the water,</hi> and put the party <hi>into the water,</hi> you might as well ſay, that Chriſt baptized <hi>in the holy Ghoſt, and fire,</hi> and that he dipped the whole man all over <hi>in the holy Ghoſt and in the fire,</hi>

                  <p>From your other Scriptures, Col. 2.12. Rom. 6.4.5. 1 Cor. 15.29. what you goe about to gather I know not, unleſſe this, that as Chriſt was buried, abode in the grave three dayes, and then roſe again: ſo the party baptized muſt be put under the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, abide there ſome conſiderable time, and then come up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine (for if you preſſe a ſimilitude of Chriſts buriall in going down into the water, and of his reſurrection in coming up out of the water; why not alſo of his abode in the grave three dayes, by abiding three dayes, or ſome anſwerable time under the water?) which will make bad worke; neither can any ſuch thing be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:111961:13"/> from thoſe Scriptures. Now to uſe your owne words: Let any man that is not quite fallen out with his reaſon judge, whether in all theſe Scriptures be any ſyllable that ſpeaks more for dipping then for ſprinkling or waſhing with water? Men may well be at agreement with their reaſon, and yet perceive no ſuch thing as you inferre hence.<note place="margin">Col. 2.12. Rom. 6.4, 5. 1 Cor. 15.29.</note> But I would demand here two Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions: Firſt, How can you gather from theſe places, a dipping of the whole man over head and under water? and that a ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude of Chriſts death, buriall, and riſing againe, to be repreſented by dipping into the water is ſignified here? Theſe Scriptures ſhew indeed that the end of our baptiſme is to ſeale our commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with Chriſt, in his death and reſurrection, by which we are dead to ſinne, and raiſed againe to holineſſe. But if you will preſſe hence a neceſſitie of reſemblance of Chriſts death, buriall, and reſurrection by our deſcending into, abiding in, and coming up out of the water;<note place="margin">Pro. 30.6. Revel. 22.18.</note> take heed leſt you be one of thoſe which adde to Gods word, leſt he reprove you as a lyer: and adde unto you the plagues written in his Booke. For I know not any word of God wherein this repreſentation is neceſſarily implied, much leſſe expreſſed. Beſides, if you urge death and reſurrection to be reſembled by deſcenſion into, and aſcenſion out of the water: you muſt urge alſo buriall (which is principally there expreſſed) by the biding of the whole man, head and all under for a time an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to Chriſts three dayes buriall, which cannot be without danger (yea certainty) of drowning.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If it ſhould be granted that a repreſentation and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance of Chriſts death, buriall, and reſurrection is ſet before us in baptiſme; and ſo of our death to ſinne, and riſing again to holineſſe: Yet I would demand, why may not this be repreſented as well by infuſion of water, as by dipping? Can you give me an example of ſo many killed and buried by immerſion or dipping into the water; as I can give of them that have beene put to death and buried, by the infuſion of water? I am ſure a whole world of men and other earthly creatures (thoſe few that were in the Arke excepted) were buried in the univerſall Deluge at once, by infuſion, not by dipping. So that infuſion or ſprinkling,<note place="margin">Gen. 6.27. &amp; 7.11, 12.</note> may well as clearely ſignifie death and buriall, as dipping. And to the preſervation of <hi>Noah</hi> and thoſe that were with him, by the Arke, (on which waters were poured) from drowning: the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:111961:14"/> compares baptiſme, as its antitype. Wherefore you might doe well to be henceforth a little more modeſt, and not talke as if all men were fallen out with their reaſon which will not jumpe with you in your weake conceits.</p>
                  <p>Now we come to your inference or concluſion, which being built on the crazie and rotten foundation of ſuch vaine and fond premiſes, falls to the ground of it ſelfe. And whereas you ſay, that, <hi>The Greek wanted not words to expreſſe any other act as well as dipping.</hi> I anſwer. Neither did the Greek want words to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe onely dipping of the whole man all over into the water; or dowſing and plunging over head and under the water (which you would have <hi>Baptizo</hi> to ſignifie, but neither have nor can prove that it doth) if the holy Ghoſt had meant any ſuch act. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth the Spirit of God need your helpe to find out fit words. It ſeemed fit to that wiſe Spirit to uſe <hi>Baptizo,</hi> which ſignifies to waſh, whether by dipping or ſprinkling; waſhing onely being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be ſignificant, and not either dipping or ſprinkling. Whereas you ſay, that <hi>It cannot be proved that baptiſme was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred any other way then by dipping, for at leaſt a thouſand years after Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> I leave the proofe and trialls of that to Hiſtorians and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquaries, as being unfurniſhed with the Records of Antiquitie: though I conceive your Aſſertion is as bold and groundleſſe as your others are proved to be. Secondly, Why do you not prove that dowſing over head, and under water, was uſed for at leaſt a thouſand years after Chriſt? Thirdly, How can you tell it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be proved that ſprinkling was uſed of all that time? Will you perſwade people that you have read over all the writings of the Ancients; or that you are ſo honeſt, faithfull, and unerring, that your word muſt be taken for an Oracle without proofe?</p>
                  <p>As for your cleare reſulting conſequence, as I ſaid, It is built on too weake grounds to ſtand, and therefore may be ſafely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied as a plaine untruth. And whereas you apply the words of <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Ananias</hi> unto us,<note place="margin">Act. 2.38. Act. 22.16. 1 Sam. 15.23.</note> as to unbaptized perſons, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading us to ariſe and be baptized: Intimating, that for us to refuſe this your Charge, is rebellion and ſtubborneſſe, as witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft, iniquitie and idolatrie. I would adviſe you take heed of, and repent for abuſing Scripture, as in theſe and a great part of your quotations you doe moſt groſly. God will not hold them
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:111961:14"/> guiltleſſe that take his name in vaine. When you come to us with the ſame ſpirit and authoritie, as <hi>Peter, Ananias,</hi> and <hi>Samuel</hi> had; we will hearken to you.</p>
                  <p>Now though what hath beene ſaid in anſwer to this diſputers Arguments againſt baptizing by ſprinkling, or infuſion; and for onely dipping or plunging might ſuffice; yet I will adde ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more to what hath been written, endeavouring to make it appeare, that waſhing, whether it be by dipping, or ſprinkling, is the externall act required in this Sacrament, to be uſed; and that ſprinkling, or infuſion, is as (if not more) agreeable to the nature and inſtitution of this Sacrament, as dipping, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argument</hi> 1. As the word uſed ſignifieth waſhing, (as hath beene ſhewed) ſo the thing repreſented, ſignified, and ſealed in this Sacrament, is ſet forth in the Scripture by the phraſe of waſhing, or cleanſing, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11. <hi>But ye are waſhed,</hi>

As that the Canonicall Scriptures are the word of God, that God is one in Eſſence, yet three in Perſons; that Chriſt is the Sonne of God, &amp;c.

Elſe men could never be aſſured of their owne or others miniſtrie, whether it be true or falſe: (for the qualitie of men is onely knowne unto God, and in the ſtation of the beſt there may be ſomewhat irregular and wanting exact perfection) but princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally on Chriſts inward call, diſcerned by the gifts, propenſitie,

                  <p>Now to your poſition; <q rend="inline">That, they muſt be Elders choſen by a true Church, which is a congregation of beleevers.</q> That I may know your meaning: I would demand of you,</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, Whether you mean that of neceſſitie the whole Church and every particular member therof, muſt be preſent at the choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of a Miniſter, and give their voice expreſſely therein. If this be your meaning, it is neither proved in the Scriptures you bring, nor any other. Or whether by being choſen by a Church, you meane no more then to be choſen by ſome ſpeciall perſons in a Church, that repreſent the whole Church. If this be your mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I will concurre with you in that particular, as knowing that women and children have no voyce, though members. Nor is it neceſſary that every particular member of the reſt ſhould give his vote: ſith at ſuch times oft ſome are occaſioned to be abſent, and if preſent, they yet may be ſo many, that they cannot well give particularly their voices, and though many refuſe to give their votes, yet if the greater part vote for him it is ſufficient.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, Whereas you ſay. Conſtitute of Saints and belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers by calling. I aske, whether you meane thoſe that are ſo effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually called, that they are really and truly become Saints and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers, ſo that there is not a wicked man or hypocrite among them, and that the mixture of wicked men or hypocrites among them which call the Elders, cauſeth them not to be true Elders. If this be your meaning, looke over that place which you brought for proofe of your opinion, and you ſhall finde it clearely confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.2. if you compare that verſe with <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 3. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. and 6. throughout. <hi>Chap.</hi> 8. and 10. and 11. and 15. and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.20, 21. and almoſt throughout both Epiſtles. By comparing which places you ſhall ſee, that theſe beleevers and Saints by calling, did not ſo walke, either in regard of ſoundneſſe of judgement, puritie of worſhip, or holineſſe of life, as to give cleare evidence of their effectuall calling or ſound ſanctification. So compare, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.7. with <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.18, 19. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.7, 8. with <hi>Chap.</hi> 16. <hi>v.</hi> 17, 18. and then ſpeake your conſcience, whether you can judge all theſe down right beleevers effectually called, really Saints. But if by beleevers, or Saints by calling, you meane ſuch as are called to faith and holineſſe, and withall make a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion by externally giving their names up to Chriſt, and accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:111961:19"/> outwardly the covenant, promiſing faith and obedience unto Gods word; though there may be hypocrites and wicked livers: we concurre with you, as knowing that they muſt be Chriſtians by profeſſion, and partakers of the heavenly calling (not Iews, Pagans or other Infidels) that goe to the making up of a viſible Church; and ſuch are our Churches, whereby the Elders of whom we ſpeak have been choſen or accepted.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, whether your meaning be the Congregation or peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple only, without the precedency, concurrence, examination, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and Ordination of Miniſters, muſt chuſe their Governours or Officers, or elſe they are not true Governours or Officers: If you meane ſo, looke backe on the Scripture cited by you <hi>Acts</hi> 14.23. with other places, <hi>Act.</hi> 6.3.6. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.14. and 5.22. where it appeareth, that Miniſters had the chiefe hand in making Miniſters.</p>
                  <p>Now theſe things propounded: I anſwer to your poſition, that we can eaſily ſhew, that our people in <hi>England,</hi> in regard of their generall and unanimous conſent to (and profeſſion of faith in) the ſame truth, contained in the book of God, acceptation of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and giving up of their names unto Chriſt, are a Church or Congregation of faithfull people or Saints by calling, though many doe not walke anſwerably to their calling (the greater is their ſinne, and ſhame, and ſhall be their condemnation unleſſe they repent.) And in regard of the many ſeverall companies of the faithfull, by whom Gods worſhip is performed apart one from another; there are many Churches or Congregations of Saints by calling in our Land. We can ſhew alſo, that although our Elders of whom we ſpeake, have not been choſen by the whole Congregations, in reſpect of every particular member; yet by ſome ſpeciall perſons (in behalfe of the whole Congregation) to whom that charge was committed by them, (or (which was their ſinne) uſurped from them) and that the people at leaſt by accepting them ſo choſen, did make choice of them in their own perſons. And that whatſoever diſorders or defects have been in the choice, do not nullifie their miniſtery. <q rend="inline">As for ſuch as have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged the unlawfulneſſe of their miniſtery, or plead meere qualifications (of whom you ſpeake) let them anſwer for themſelves, how they can, we are not bound to ſtand to their principles, or maintain their opinions.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for the ſeven next Objections, into the Anſwer whereof
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:111961:19"/> you digreſſe (moſt of them being belike fained of your ſelf, that you may finde ſomewhat to ſay) beſide extravagant imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencies, malicious and maſter-like cenſures, and ſome unqueſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned truths, which are yeelded by us, but do nothing profit your cauſe, nor hurt ours: I ſee nothing that it is worth while to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, but what may be ſufficiently anſwered unto, by what hath been ſaid before. Neither do I intend to follow you in your idle roving. Onely it is to be obſerved, that this <hi>A. R.</hi> cannot endure to heare of a Synode, though a ſpeciall and maine ordinance of God, to compoſe differences, and quiet the hearts of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which have been diſquieted by trouble-Churches. See <hi>Acts</hi> 15. the whole Chapter.</p>
                  <p>Becauſe (ſaith he) a Synod cannot make a Laſt to ſuit every ones foot, which in plain Engliſh is this, they will not ſuffer Ieſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its, Papiſts, Arminians, idle Miniſters, Anabaptiſts, Antinomians, and Familiſts to have their own way in practiſe, worſhip, opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp;c. Neither will they ſuffer every man to abuſe the Scripture after his owne fancie, and vent abroad his poyſonous conceipts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the ſimple, to draw diſciples after them. As if it were better to let every man follow his owne deviſes, and labour to draw others into his opinions (ſo that whoſoever is moſt cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, pragmaticall and able to conform his doctrin to the humours of men, ſhall goe away with moſt diſciples, to the overthrow of thouſands of ſoules,) than that there ſhould be a conſultation of godly, learned, &amp; conſcientious Miniſters, about the eſtabliſhment of religion. And here it is further to be noted, that the children of darkeneſſe, though in ſome particulars they be oppoſite one to another, as Papiſts, Arminians, ignorant, lazy and malignant Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and licentious Atheiſts on the one ſide, and Anabaptiſts with Antinomians and Familiſts on the other ſide, doe differ from, yea directly oppoſe one another in ſome particulars; yet they agree together, as in oppoſing Gods faithfull Miniſters and people, ſo in hating the light, and refuſing to be brought unto the triall of Gods word, and to be tyed unto the Rules thereof, as they ſhall be found out and applyed by an Aſſembly of faithfull Miniſters.</p>
                  <p>Again, it is to be obſerved, That theſe men take it in high in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation, that any ſhould go about to reſtrain them from abuſing the Scripture, and carrying about the ſimple people with every wind of doctrin, by whom they may be had in admiration, while they are ſuffered to go on in their bold preſumption, and confident
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:111961:20"/> venting of their ignorant conceits, and malicious rayling againſt authoritie; which may appeare by this Authours abuſe of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <q rend="inline">for a colour of accuſation of thoſe that would reſtraine them, and by his tale of a Miniſter in the Weſt.</q> But I come to the fourth Conſideration.</p>

                     </label> I Anſwer. Not the faith and repentance of the Sureties as you pretend, is the ground of our Baptiſme, (neither do we ſay ſo) but Gods gracious Covenant which he hath made with the parents and their children; (of which hereafter) Which Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant that parents may publiquely profeſſe themſelves to have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in, and with them their children, it is convenient that they (and other Sureties, if they ſee it good, to joyne ſuch with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to undertake what they promiſe in the behalfe of their children, in caſe parents ſhould be negligent, ignorant, or by ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy death, or otherwiſe diſabled to bring up their children religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly) I ſay it is convenient, that they ſhould make a profeſſion of their faith and repentance, which yet doth not at all prove that their faith and repentance is the ground of the childrens Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme. But the tenour of Gods gracious covenant, under which they profeſſe themſelves (and with them their children) to be, is the ground of this act. Now though there may be ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtifiable or unfit paſſages, in the Catechiſme or manner of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, whence you fetch your Argument, (ſeeing that it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, that our ground of baptizing Infants, is the Covenant of God made with the parents, or thoſe which are in ſtead of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, which Covenant that they are in, they teſtifie by profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing their faith and repentance, and conſidering that the anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Sureties, and the Catechizing of Children, doth nothing touch the eſſence of Baptiſme) thoſe paſſages nothing prejudice
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:111961:20"/> the truth of Childrens Baptiſme. But concerning this matter, <hi>viz.</hi> the ground of Childrens Baptiſme more hereafter.</p>

It is true the Apoſtles were to teach thoſe among the Gentiles of ripe yeares, and make them diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples before they or their children were to be baptized, becauſe they and their children were out of covenant, and ſo uncapable of the ſeales, and might not be received into covenant themſelves or their children, untill they gave up themſelves and theirs unto Chriſt by faith and repentance: which they could not ordinarily have wrought in them, but by hearing the Goſpel preached. Yet when parents had given up their names unto Chriſt, their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren being alſo given up to Chriſt by them, were capable of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme. As by <hi>Abrahams</hi> giving up himſelf unto God in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, not onely he, but alſo his children, and thoſe that were as his children, were received into Covenant, and had the ſeale thereof

                  <p>Now for what followeth, I will not proceed in maintaining thoſe further objections; which either you deviſe of your owne head, or raiſe out of others words, to whoſe principles we are not bound; your anſwers whereunto either doe not concerne us, or if any thing therein ſeeme to beare ſhew of truth and weight, it may be ſufficiently anſwered from what hath beene already laid downe.

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Arg. </seg>1</label> Our firſt Argument therefore ſhall be: To whom the ſpirituall and inviſible grace repreſented, ſignified, and ſealed in baptiſme belongeth by vertue of Gods promiſe, to them baptiſme it ſelfe belongeth, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.38, 39.</p>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:111961:22"/>
                  <p>But to the children or infants of parents beleeving, or within Covenant, belongeth by vertue of Gods promiſe, the ſpirituall grace repreſented, ſealed, and ſignified in baptiſme; to wit, the teaching of God, and the Spirit of God, which doth include all the ſpirituall bleſſings ſignified by baptiſme; as ſanctification, or regeneration, wherein is comprehended virtuall faith, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, being beſprinkled with the bloud of Chriſt, and pardon of ſinnes, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 54.13. <hi>Ier.</hi> 31.34. <hi>Ioel</hi> 2.28. <hi>Eſ.</hi> 59.21. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.39.</p>
                  <p>Therefore Baptiſme belongeth to infants of Chriſtian pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.</p>
                  <p>Both the premiſſes me thinkes ſhould be undeniable with Chriſtians, as being built on the word; and ſo the concluſion certaine. But becauſe I would cleare this Argument, againſt the cavils of the captious, and doubts of the ignorant, or ſcrupulous; I will adde ſome what by way of explanation, and confirmation.</p>
                  <p>The propoſition, for ought I know, it is not doubted of by any. It is taken as an unqueſtionable principle by <hi>A. R.</hi> and many of his arguments againſt baptizing infants, are built upon this ground: becauſe they have not regeneration, faith, remiſſion of ſinnes. And it may further appeare by theſe Scriptures, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.38. Nothing now could hinder the Eunuch from being baptized, for now the ſpirituall bleſſing appertained to him, and therefore the externall ſigne: <hi>Act.</hi> 10.47, 48. <hi>Can any forbid water, that theſe ſhould not be baptized, which have received the holy Ghoſt as well as we? And he commanded them to be baptized, &amp;c.</hi> And <hi>Chap.</hi> 11.17. The Apoſtle implies, that it had beene a withſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God, not to have baptized them on whom the gift of the holy Ghoſt had been powred. And ſo ſtill upon the profeſſion of faith, and repentance, when in the judgement of charitie, the Preachers apprehended the parties to have intereſt, and right to the ſpirituall grace, they adminiſtred the outward ſigne, though queſtionleſſe they were deceived in many: as <hi>Ananias, Sapphira, Simon Magus,</hi> &amp;c. Yet it was a ſufficient warrant to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to baptize them: becauſe ſo farre as they could judge, they were under the promiſe. For if amongſt Chriſts few Diſciples, there was one traytour, ſonne of perdition, devill: doubtleſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt thoſe many thouſands that were baptized, upon their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of faith and repentance at the preaching of <hi>Iohn,</hi> and the Apoſtles, many were hypocrites; as may appeare by the great evils that brake out in the Primitive Churches. This I adde to
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:111961:23"/> ſhew that there is no infallible certainty of the inward grace re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of, or poſſible to the Miniſter.</p>
                  <p>And that to whom the inward grace belongs, to them the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſigne belongs; appeareth in <hi>Peters</hi> exhortation in that place quoted in the propoſition, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.38, 39. <hi>And Peter ſaid unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you, in the name of Ieſus Chriſt, to the remiſſion of your ſinnes, and ye ſhall receive the gift of the holy Ghoſt: For the promiſe is to you, and to your children, and to all that are afarre off, even ſo many as the Lord our God ſhall call.</hi> Wherein he ſhews them that if they will repent, they have right unto baptiſme, as having right unto the thing ſignified in bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, <hi>viz.</hi> the remiſſion of ſinnes, by the bloud of Chriſt powred on their ſoules; and the gift of the holy Ghoſt being the Spirit of Chriſt, powred on them; of which he had ſpoken before, <hi>ver.</hi> 17. both clearely repreſented and ſignified by the infuſion, or powring of water in baptiſme. And the rather to perſwade them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and be baptized, that they might receive remiſſion of ſinnes, and the gift of the holy Ghoſt: <hi>Peter</hi> tels them, that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is to them and their children, and ſo many as God ſhould call, though afarre off: even among the Gentiles. So that if by faith and repentance they and the Gentiles ſhould accept the promiſe, they and their children ſhould have intereſt in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſinnes, and the gift of the holy Ghoſt; and ſo conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently in baptiſme; ſo that not onely the parents repenting, but alſo their children had title to the promiſe of the holy Gohſt; and ſo to the ſeale thereof.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, you object: <hi>It is not ſaid promiſes, but promiſe; and that it is not promiſes, but promiſe; not infants, but children:</hi> 
                     <q rend="inline">You promiſe us ſatisfaction by looking back to what went before in the Chapter, after a long repetition wherof, you tell us what we may gather; to wit, that the gift of the holy Ghoſt, mentioned <hi>ver.</hi> 17. to be propheſied of by <hi>Ioel;</hi> and to be received of the Father, and ſhed forth by Chriſt, <hi>ver.</hi> 33. is repeated <hi>ver.</hi> 38.</q>
                  </p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> All this maketh nothing againſt us; but for us.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, you adde: <hi>You may ſee who are meant by children,</hi> viz. <hi>the ſame that were mentioned,</hi> ver. 17. <hi>under the termes of ſonnes and daughters that ſhould prophecie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> As if the Spirit mentioned here, were onely a Spirit of prophecie. The Spirit hath divers operations; ſome ordinary, and ſome extraordinary, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.4.7, 8, 9, 10, 11. Neither is it ſaid, that all ſhall prophecie and dreame dreames.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, you ſay: <hi>Therefore no infants are meant here who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not prophecie, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Why may not infants be of the number of that <hi>all fleſh,</hi> on which God would powre his Spirit, though none of thoſe that prophecie, ſee viſions, dreame, &amp;c. For theſe effects of the Spirit are not related as common to all, on whom God would powre his Spirit; but peculiar to ſome, which had extraordinary gifts. Secondly, What hinders but they may receive the Spirit in their infancie, by which they may prophecie in ripe yeares? as we ſee in <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.15. &amp; 41. Thirdly, I anſwer; That this promiſe is not onely made concerning the extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie gifts of the Spirit which were beſtowed in the times of the Apoſtle, by which men did prophecie, dreame dreames, ſee viſions, ſpeake with tongues, &amp;c. but alſo of the ſanctifying Spirit which is common to all ages of the Church, even where ſuch miraculous and extraordinarie gifts are not beſtowed: may appeare, <hi>verſ.</hi> 30. <hi>The promiſe,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>was to all afarre off, whomſoever the Lord ſhould call:</hi> that is, all the Gentiles whom God ſhould call by the Goſpel to faith. Now no man I hope will ſay, that all whom over God called, dreamed dreames, ſaw viſions, prophecied, ſpake with ſtrange tongues, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, you adde: <q rend="inline">There is not ſo much as any colour, for baptizing of infants from hence. For the Text is not, Be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed. For the promiſe is to you, and your children; as many in Print doe falſely alledge. But repent and be baptized, &amp;c. and ye ſhall receive the gift of the Holy ghoſt. For the promiſe is to you and your children.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> If we ſhould take the words in your ſenſe, <hi>viz.</hi> that thoſe words <hi>For the promiſe is made, &amp;c.</hi> are brought as a reaſon onely of the words going immediately before; it makes nothing againſt me, for ſo the 38. <hi>verſ.</hi> containes a pregnant proofe of my propoſition, and <hi>verſ.</hi> 39. of mine aſſumption.</p>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:111961:24"/>
                  <p>Secondly, I anſwer. There is no neceſſitie can appeare, no nor probable reaſon (I beleeve) can be rendred, why the reaſon (For the promiſe, &amp;c. <hi>verſ.</hi> 39.) ſhould be referred onely to the words immediately preceding (you ſhall receive the gift of the holy Ghoſt; and not unto the exhortation, Repent, and be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, &amp;c.) which untill you could have given ſome proofe of, you might well have ſpared your immodeſt language, and hainous accuſation of falſe alledging Scripture. For the context may either be analyſed thus. Firſt, <hi>Peter</hi> exhorts to repent, and be baptized; then he ſpurres them on by a reaſon taken from the effect, <hi>viz.</hi> remiſſion and the gift of the Spirit: ſecondly, from the promiſe that God had made concerning the thing ſignified, <hi>viz.</hi> powring his Spirit; which promiſe belonged to them and their children: therefore they ſhould receive the ſigne which God had inſtituted to ſignifie it, which may ſeeme the moſt genuine reſolution of the Text. Or ſecondly; This reaſon may be underſtood as brought both to the exhortation, (Repent, and be baptized) and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, (And you ſhall receive remiſſion of ſinnes, and the gift of the holy Ghoſt:) for conſidering that baptiſme, and the gift of the holy Ghoſt are correlatives, as the ſigne and thing ſignified, the reaſon well may (that I ſay not neceſſarily muſt) be referred to both. Or thirdly, if we grant that it is immediately referred to the foregoing promiſe, yet it muſt neceſſarily be taken as a reaſon of the exhortation at leaſt mediately: for ſeeing the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of remiſſion of ſinnes, and the holy Ghoſt, is brought as a reaſon to perſwade them to be baptized; and theſe words, For the promiſe is to you, &amp;c. is brought as a confirmation of the promiſe;<note place="margin">Cauſa cauſae eſt cauſa cauſati.</note> and conſidering that the cauſe of the cauſe is the cauſe of the cauſed, and the reaſon of the reaſon, is the reaſon of the thing proved by that reaſon, this (For the promiſe, &amp;c.) muſt needs be brought as a reaſon why they ſhould be baptized; and ſo thoſe who bring this as a reaſon that the Apoſtle gives, why they ſhould be baptized, joyning the thing argued, and the Argument together, and omitting that which was interpoſed, as not perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to the purpoſe; are quit from your ſlander of falſe alledging Scripture; and you convinced to be a falſe accuſer of the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</p>
                  <p>The next Objection that you frame I owne not. Aſſenting that it is true, that neither theſe Iewes, nor the Gentiles were in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, untill they had entred into the ſame by repentance and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:111961:24"/> faith, ſeeing that the old Covenant was now abrogated, and the Gentiles had beene hitherto foreiners: ſo that you will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that whenſoever Iewes or Gentiles ſhould receive the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe by faith and repentance, it did not onely belong unto them, but alſo to their children. For though it be expreſſed to the Iews, (That the promiſe was to them and their children) it is to be underſtood, to hold of the Gentiles alſo. For now the partition wall was removed, and the Iewes had no priviledge for their childrens having right unto the promiſe, any more then the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of beleeving Gentiles.</p>
                  <p>Thus farre I have digreſſed in anſwer to ſome objections made againſt the Scripture which was brought for the proofe of my propoſition, though it might be handled as well in the aſſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; yet becauſe I have more to ſay on the aſſumption, I brought theſe objections under the propoſition. The ſumme of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition muſt be remembred to be this. Where is right to the ſpirituall bleſſing promiſed in the word, and ſealed in baptiſme, there is right to baptiſme: which ſtands firme againſt whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hath beene objected. I come to the aſſumption.</p>
                  <p>The places of Scripture quoted to confirme the aſſumption have beene ſpoken of before. Onely we may conſider now, Firſt, what things are promiſed in thoſe Scriptures expreſly. Secondly, what is implied. Thirdly, to whom theſe promiſes are made.</p>
                  <p>For the firſt, God promiſeth to be their teacher, yea though they be uncapable of humane diſcipline (They ſhall not teach one another, but they ſhall all be taught of God) <hi>Eſa.</hi> 54.13. <hi>Ier.</hi> 31.34. Againe, that he will give, yea powre his Spirit, and that his Spirit ſhall be upon them, <hi>Ioel</hi> 2.28. <hi>Eſ.</hi> 59.21.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, under theſe two expreſſions, yea each of them ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally, are comprehended all thoſe things that are requiſite for our being in Covenant with God; and all thoſe ſpirituall graces that give us right to the ſeale of entrance: as firſt Regeneration, which is the proper and certaine worke of the ſpirit of ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.5. which ſpirit of regeneration to be ſignified by the water of baptiſme may appeare by that Scripture, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.5. &amp; Tit. 3.5. Againe, this implies communion with Chriſt, which muſt needs be by faith, actuall or virtuall, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6.45. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6. For who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is taught of God, and hath the Spirit of Chriſt, muſt needs have Chriſt, and ſo it follows that ſuch have right unto remiſſion of ſinnes.</p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:111961:25"/>
                  <p>Thirdly, theſe promiſes belong unto the children of the Church, the ſonnes and daughters of the faithfull, all of them from the leaſt to the greateſt; the ſeede of the faithfull, and their ſeeds ſeed, as may appeare in the Scriptures quoted; and here muſt be comprehended, infants as well as others, who have right unto the promiſe by vertue of their parents entering into Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God, as Act. 2.39. The Apoſtle bids them repent and be baptized; (and ſo enter into Covenant) for the promiſe, ſaith he, is unto you and your children; ſo that there can no reaſon be given why infants ſhould be excluded from theſe promiſes: un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe any one ſhall ſay that infants are uncapable of theſe gifts, which this <hi>A. R.</hi> ſeemes to hold, in many places of his booke; which opinion is more worthy deteſtation then confutation. Are not infants capable of ſinne? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.5 and therefore of ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication: ſhall the firſt <hi>Adams</hi> diſobedience be available to bring guilt and defilement? and not Chriſts obedience to procure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and ſanctification? Or is there no remedie for the poore infants of beleeving parents; but if they die before they come to the uſe of reaſon they muſt neceſſarily periſh, as being born the children of wrath, and being uncapable of remedie? Or doth this man hold, that they are brutes without ſoule in that he compares baptizing of infants to circumciſing of Camels or Aſſes?<note place="margin">2 Part, pag. 21.</note> Are not theſe profane Atheiſticall conceits, contrary to the promiſes of God, cleare teſtimonie of Scripture, and exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as of <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt, who was ſanctified and moved by the Spirit even in his mothers wombe?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> But what muſt we then beleeve: that all the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Chriſtians are already indued with the holy Ghoſt, taught of God, and ſanctified, &amp;c. ſo ſoone as borne, or in their infancie?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is enough to prove their right to baptiſme, that they are under the promiſe and intereſſed therein, by vertue of their parents being (at leaſt externally) in Covenant: ſo that whether they have already received the Spirit, or have a promiſe thereof, it ſufficeth to give them a right to the Sacrament. As theſe are bid repent, and ſo come under promiſe (themſelves with their children) and then be baptized; and afterward they ſhall receive the holy Ghoſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> But muſt we think that all children of Chriſtian parents that are baptized, either have or ſhall receive the Spirit, and ſo be ſaved?</p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:111961:25"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw. Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt, and the Apoſtles, though they were not to beleeve that amongſt thoſe multitudes whom they bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, there were none but truely had or ſhould receive the Spirit, for it was after proved by the event, that many were hypocrites, yet they turned away none, becauſe by their externall confeſſion of ſinne, and profeſſion of faith and repentance, they ſhewed themſelves to be externally in Covenant, and ſo to have right to the outward ſeale, which they therefore adminiſtred to one as well as to another. So though we are not bound to think that all the children borne of parents in covenant are, or ſhall be ſanctified: yet becauſe they are outwardly in covenant and under the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, (which promiſe God makes good as ſeemeth good in his eyes;) therefore the Miniſter, that is not to judge of the inward worke of ſanctification on the heart, whether preſent or future, but of the outward eſtate, (neither if he could diſcerne the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward eſtate might he withhold the outward priviledge from any (though wanting inward grace) that hath right thereunto by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under covenant outwardly) may and ought to adminiſter baptiſme to the children of all Chriſtian parents under his charge that requires it, ſo long as by wilfull Apoſtaſie from the faith, or juſt excommunication wherein they obſtinately continue, they with their children are not diſcovenanted.</p>

                     </label> I Anſwer. 1. Theſe promiſes made to the Chriſtian Church, are like to that promiſe made to the Iewiſh Church, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.6. And the Lord thy God will circumciſe thine heart, and the heart of thy ſeed, to love the Lord thy God. Now this they were to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, not onely or principally of Proſelytes that ſhould be converted to the Church, nor onely of their poſteritie, when they came to the uſe of reaſon; but even of Infants, as may appeare in that God appointed them to circumciſe their Infants. For cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion of the fleſh, was a ſign of circumciſion of the heart; which if infants had not been capable of, God would not have commanded the outward ſigne to have been adminiſtred unto them. And ſo theſe promiſes made to the Chriſtian Church, to their ſeed, to their ſeeds ſeed, to their children, from the leaſt to
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:111961:26"/> the greateſt, appertain to infants in the Chriſtian Church as well as others. The univerſall note being underſtood, <hi>De generibus ſingulorum,</hi> not <hi>de ſingulis generum,</hi> as they ſay; of all ſorts, ſexes, ages, and condition ſome: though every individuall of all ſorts be not comprehended therein. And therefore Baptiſme ſealing ſuch promiſes, belongs to Infants in the Chriſtian Church, as well as circumciſion did in the Iewiſh.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I anſwer. It is abſurd to underſtand theſe promiſes onely of the ſpirituall ſeed, as if they belonged only to the rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate; For what is it to be taught of God and have the Spirit powred, but to be converted or regenerated, and drawn to Chriſt; ſo that by this interpretation, the meaning of theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes ſhould be this much. I will powre my Spirit on whom I have or ſhall powre my Spirit, and they ſhall be taught of God, that are or ſhall be taught of God. It is true, God may here well promiſe a greater meaſure of the Spirit and illumination, where he hath given ſome meaſure. But withall it is certaine, here is promiſed the Spirit and illumination alſo, to thoſe that are quite deſtitute, and ſo to ſuch as are not yet the ſpirituall ſeed of the Church.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, I anſwer. What matter of conſolation can this be to beleeving parents, if not withſtanding their prayer for, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious education of their children, none of theſe or the like pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes belong to them; but onely to the ſpirituall ſeed of the Church, that is, ſuch as are already converted, and declare their converſion by actuall faith? What ground of prayer for, or hope of the ſalvation of their children have they, more then of the Heathens, if this be admitted?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Argument.</hi> If Governours of families upon their belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and tendring up themſelves, and theirs to God and Chriſt, were not onely themſelves baptized; but all the perſons in their houſhold, and which were under their government, of what age ſoever, were baptized alſo; ſo that where there is no mention of preaching to, or the beliefe of any but the Governours them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; yet their whole houſholds were dedicated unto God in Baptiſme: Then it is lawfull (yea a dutie) to Chriſtian parents to tender their children (being part of their family) unto God in Baptiſme, and Miniſters have good ground, yea, ingagement for baptizing ſuch.</p>
                  <p>But Governours of Families upon their beleeving and tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:111961:26"/> up themſelves and theirs unto God and Chriſt, were not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly themſelves baptized; but all the perſons in their houſhold, or which were under their government: ſo that where there is no mention of preaching to, or the beliefe of any but the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours themſelves; yet their whole houſholds were dedicated un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God in Baptiſme. <hi>Act.</hi> 16.14, 15 and 31, 32, 33. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.6.</p>
                  <p>Therefore it is lawfull (yea the dutie) for Chriſtian parents or governours of families, to tender their infants, which are part of their houſhold, unto God in Baptiſme, and Miniſters ought to baptize ſuch being tendred of their parents.</p>
                  <p>The Major needs no confirmation, it being granted by all, yea, by the Adverſaries themſelves (as I conceive) taken for an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable principle, that the Apoſtles example in baptizing is a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient warrant for us, and that ſuch are to be admitted to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme now, as were admitted by the Apoſtles: For moſt of their reaſoning is grounded hereupon, and they hence condemne our baptizing of Infants; becauſe (ſay they) it is not agreeable to the practiſe of the Apoſtles; ſo that that Baptiſme w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is agreeable to the Baptiſm of the Apoſtles, is warantable by their own grants: and ſo the ſequele ſtandeth firme and good. If in the Apoſtles times, whole families of beleeving governours were baptized, they ought ſo now, and ſo conſequently the infants of thoſe fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, which are parts thereof, if there be any ſuch: For as <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> and his Family, was a pattern unto all ſuch as ſhould enter into the Covenant of grace during the time of circumciſion; that as he and his Family were circumciſed, ſo ſhould all, whether of his poſteritie, or proſelytes, circumciſe all their Males, even the babes: So thoſe primitive Converts, that were the firſt fruits of the Gentiles, and when they beleeved were baptized with their whole families; are examples for the beleevers of all Ages to follow, in conſecrating themſelves and theirs to God in Baptiſm.</p>
                  <p>As for the Minor; thoſe places of Scripture cited prove it. <hi>Act.</hi> 16.31, 32, 33. To the Iaylour demanding, what he ſhould doe that he might be ſaved; <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Sylas</hi> anſwer, bidding him beleeve in the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, promiſing that he ſhould be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and his houſhold. Teaching that the beleefe of a father, or go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of a family, is ſufficient to bring a whole family that is at his diſpoſing and to be ruled by him, into a ſtate of ſalvation, ſo farre, as that now they are within the Covenant, and ſo conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently have right unto the ſeale of initiation. It is ſaid indeed,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:111961:27"/> that they ſpake the word of the Lord unto him, and all that were in the houſe. <hi>viz.</hi> ſo many as were capable of inſtruction; But there is no word of the actuall beliefe or repentance by expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, word, or action, of any in the family, except onely of the Iay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour himſelf, whoſe repentance and faith (at leaſt initiall) is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by the effects thereof. <hi>viz.</hi> his humiliation, and deſire of ſalvation, <hi>verſ.</hi> 29. and 30. and more fully by the fruits of them, declared <hi>verſ.</hi> 33. in taking them the ſame houre of the night, and waſhing their ſtripes,<note place="margin">

                        </gap>.</note> and then it is ſaid, that he and all his were baptized ſtraight-way. Which evidently ſheweth, that the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours faith and repentance, or being within the Covenant, doth ſufficiently intereſſe their inferiours, that are at their diſpoſe, to the Covenant of Grace, and ſo to the Seale of entrance, at leaſt if they be not refractary, wilfully and ſtubbornly refuſing to be given up to God by their ſuperiours. The like may be ſaid of <hi>Stephanus</hi> his family, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.16. But moſt cleare, and expreſſe, is the example of <hi>Lydia, Act.</hi> 16.14, 15. When the Lord had opened her heart, to attend to thoſe things that were ſpoken of <hi>Paul,</hi> ſhe was baptized and her houſhold; Not a word ſpoken of preaching to, or actuall faith, and repentance of the reſt. So that it is apparent, that as upon <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith and repentance, and intereſt in God, his whole Family, whether thoſe that were born in the houſe, or thoſe that were bought with money, yea, even his infants of eight dayes old, had ſo farre intereſt in God, that (upon his tendring them up unto God according to his gracious appointment) now they had right unto the Seal of Circumciſion after God had once inſtituted it: ſo Chriſtian governours of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, or parents by their faith and repentance, are meanes of bringing ſalvation to their families, and intereſſing thoſe that are under them to God and Chriſt, ſo farre as that they have right unto Baptiſme; at leaſt except they ſtubbornly refuſe the Seale, and reject the Covenant.</p>

Epheſ. 1.1. Phil. 1.1. Col. 1.2. Gal. 1.2. 1 Theſ. 1.1. 2 Theſ. 1.1.</note> as may appeare in the places quoted in the margine: ſo that all the members of the Church are Saints, all Saints are members of the Church. Yet it is to be noted by the way, they were Saints by calling, or called to be Saints. Not ſo, that every member of theſe Churches were truly ſanctified, but ſuch as had beene cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to holineſſe; and made (at leaſt) an externall profeſſion of obeying this heavenly call. For ſome among thoſe ſanctified ones, or Saints by calling, were notorious offenders, and ſuch as were ſtained with groſſe errours; as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.3. &amp; 5.1, 2. &amp; 6.1.8.13. ſo <hi>Chap.</hi> 8.11. &amp; 15. 2 Cor. 12.21. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.15. Yet it was ſufficient to make them Saints by calling, and members of the viſible Church, that they were partakers of the heavenly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.1. and ſo they had externall right to the Sacrament,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:111961:29"/> although if they did not walke worthy their calling, they brought upon themſelves the greater condemnation.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is confirmed hence. In that holineſſe comprehends all the conditions, or qualifications that are requiſite to baptiſme. Holineſſe cannot be without communion with Chriſt, regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and remiſſion by the Spirit and Bloud of Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.7. So that as much as a man is holy, ſo much he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with Chriſt, regeneration and remiſſion. If indeed and truth, he be holy, then is he inwardly and really united unto Chriſt, regenerated, and juſtified: If outwardly and in profeſſion onely he be holy, then hath he communion with Chriſt, regeneration, and remiſſion onely outwardly, and in profeſſion, as <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.29. Thoſe Apoſtates are ſaid to account the bloud of the Covenant wherewith they were ſanctified prophane, and to doe deſpite to the Spirit of Grace. Theſe were not truly and inwardly ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified (for then ſhould they have never fallen away) but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly outwardly, faederally, and in reſpect of externall profeſſion. Yet this externall holineſſe is as much as the Miniſter can diſcern, or require as neceſſary, for receiving into the outward covenant and admitting to the ſeale of entrance.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, this is confirmed by that Scripture cited in the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.25, 26, 27. where it is ſhewed that the Church is ſanctified and purged by Chriſt in the waſhing of water in the word, that he might make it to himſelfe, a glorious Church, not having ſpot or wrinkle, or any ſuch thing; but that it ſhould be holy and unblameable. Wherein theſe two propoſitions (making for the confirmation of my Propoſition) are plainly contained. Firſt, that the Church is ſanctified by Chriſt, and that it is an holy ſocietie; which holineſſe is ſuch a proper adjunct or unſeparable propertie of the Church, that whoſoever is holy muſt needs be a member of the Church. Secondly, that this Church which Chriſt ſo loved, for which he gave himſelfe, which he hath made holy, he hath cleanſed with the waſhing of water in the word; which whether it be meant of the outward ſigne or thing ſignified in baptiſme, or rather both; doth apparently ſhew that the whole Church and all the members thereof being holy, have right to the outward waſhing of water in baptiſme.</p>
                  <p>To the Minor or Aſſumption; That the children of Chriſtian parents are holy. Firſt, it might be proved from the ſame place, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.25, 26, 27. For otherwiſe unleſſe it be granted that all
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:111961:29"/> the children of Chriſtian parents are ſo faederally holy, that at leaſt ſome of them are ſanctified in deed and truth, it will follow that they are not loved of Chriſt, none of thoſe for whom Chriſt gave himſelfe, nor part of the Church at leaſt in their infancie, and conſequently thoſe children of Chriſtian parents that die before the years of diſcretion, and actuall faith, muſt unavoidably and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medileſly periſh; and that the parents of ſuch can have no hope at all of their eſcaping eternall damnation; not withſtanding all the promiſes that God hath made to his people and their poſteritie: which opinion, what Chriſtian heart doth not abhorre?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, but for the fuller proofe of the point, that children of parents whereof the one at leaſt is a beleever, are holy, that place, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14. is moſt direct and cleare, where the Apoſtle ſaith, For the unbeleeving husband is ſanctified by the wife;<note place="margin">

                        </gap>.</note> and the unbeleeving wife is ſanctified by the husband; elſe were your children uncleane, but now they are holy; whence we may note,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that the word holy, is the ſame that is uſed elſe-where, for Saints, as the proper title of the members of the Church,<note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>.</note> 
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.7. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.2, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that the reaſon why theſe children are ſaid to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, is the faith of the parents, or one parent at leaſt, to whom the other parent is ſanctified, by vertue of the beleeving parents faith, (according to thoſe generall rules, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.4, 5. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.15.) Whence it was that the beleeving yoke-fellow had the lawfull and ſanctified uſe of the unbeleeving yoke-fellow. For though it be unlawfull for a beleever to marry an infidell, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.14. Yet when of unbeleevers, who were married together in the time of infidelitie, one is called, the other is not; the calling of the one to grace doth not diſſolve or annihilate their marriage (which is Gods ordinance, and therefore good) if the unbeleever be content to live in marriage fellowſhip with the beleeving mate. So that Gods Covenant with the beleeving parent, or parents, is the ground of the childes holineſſe; for (as hath beene touched be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) in regard of externall covenant with God, the ſtate of the parents, or better parent, and of the child is the ſame. If the parent be in Covenant, the child (though by nature the child of wrath, yet by Gods grace) is borne in Covenant, and ſo he and his poſteritie continues untill any of them caſt themſelves and their poſteritie out of Covenant by Apoſtaſie. The child that
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:111961:30"/> is borne of parents out of Covenant, remaines out of Covenant, unleſſe either the parents, or ſome that are in ſtead of parents, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing called of God, give up themſelves and the child unto God, or the child coming to yeares of diſcretion be called into the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in his owne perſon.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Hence it followeth that the holineſſe of the children of beleeving parents, is not neceſſarily internall and reall holineſſe; ſo that it be externall and faederall, it ſufficeth to make them mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the viſible Church. For as of thoſe <hi>Corinthians</hi> and others that are called Saints, we cannot infallibly gather that all were internally ſanctified, it was ſufficient to make them externall members, that they were both Saints by calling: ſo it is ſufficient to make the children ſo farre holy as to be members of the Church and outwardly in Covenant, if their parents were outwardly in Covenant. What is inwardly wrought, it is not for man to judge.</p>
                  <p>Now let us ſee what <hi>A. R.</hi> objecteth to this place of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">A. R.</note>For anſwer, you lay down ſome grounds: as, Firſt, <hi>There is but one Covenant now on foot, which is the Covenant of grace and ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> Heb. 7.22. &amp; 8.13. &amp; 10.9.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> We grant you this, and more too. Namely, that never ſince <hi>Adams</hi> fall was there any Covenant, properly ſo called, made with mankind by God, but the Covenant of grace and ſalvation: Where read you of any Covenant of works and damnation?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, You ſay: <q rend="inline">That there is but one manner of enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and being in the Covenant, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.3.5.6. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.19, 20, 21, 22.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> True, If you meane being in that Covenant inwardly, ſpiritually, and ſavingly, and the ſame ever was the manner of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and entering into Covenant ſince <hi>Adams</hi> fall, <hi>viz.</hi> by Ieſus Chriſt, or regeneration.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, You ſay: <q rend="inline">There is but one holineſſe now accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble unto God; which is inward, ſpirituall, and in truth, without which no outward obedience, or conformitie to any worſhip is warrantable or acceptable, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.23, 24. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> If you underſtand it of ſuch warrantableneſſe, as finds acceptation with God in the party performing it, as your latter ſeemes to expreſſe the former: This is not queſtioned nor denied by any that I know. But why doe you limit your propoſitions by
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:111961:30"/> the particle [Now,] as if though now outward obedience and conformitie to any ordinance, be not acceptable without inward holineſſe; yet it ſometimes had been? which is utterly untrue, as may appeare, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. and 51. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 1. <hi>Ier.</hi> 6. and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every where.</p>
                  <p>Now you come directly to anſwer. <q rend="inline">Hence (ſay you) it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, that if beleevers children be in Covenant, and have true holineſſe, then they are all ſaved old and young. But all belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers children are not ſaved, no not of faithfull <hi>Abraham</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 10.21. with <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.27. Therefore the children of beleevers are not in the Covenant now on foot, nor ought to be baptized.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> You might as well reaſon thus. If <hi>Simon Magus, Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias,</hi> and <hi>Sapphira,</hi> with many other hypocrites, in the Primitive Churches, whom yet the Apoſtles baptized, and called Saints, and faithfull, were in the Covenant, and had this true holineſſe, or were truly Saints; then they muſt needs be all ſaved. But they were not all ſaved. Therefore they were no beleevers or Saints, nor in the Covenant now on foot; and therefore ſhould not have beene baptized. The Apoſtles belike, wanted you to direct and controll them, and ſhew whom they ſhould have baptized, and whom not.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I anſwer directly. Though true holineſſe be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie for ſpirituall and internall being in Covenant, and for eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſalvation; yet the outward holineſſe of the party conſiſting in externall being in Covenant, is ſufficient to warrant a Miniſter to baptize; otherwiſe he ſhould never have warrant to baptize: for none knowes the heart, (ſo as to judge of inward holineſſe infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly) but God.</p>
                  <q>You adde that we object notwithſtanding all this that you have ſaid, Why may not infants be in the Covenant outwardly, having faederall holineſſe, and in that ſenſe be holy; and ſo to be admitted to the outward ordinance of baptiſme, as infants were unto circumciſion in time of the Law; and in the State of the Iewes? To this you anſwer. That the State or the Church of the Iewes were under the old Covenant and Law, and ſtood not by faith or circumciſion of the heart; as this of the Goſpel doth; but ſtood meerly upon nature, and the circumciſion of the fleſh, and accordingly had their outward and faederall holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and outward cleanſings; all which were aboliſhed with
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:111961:31"/> their State, and no ſuch holineſſe or diſtinction is now between any perſons in the world.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Secondly, though they were under the old Covenant legally diſpenſed, wherein grace was more obſcurely and ſparing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly communicated to Gods people then it is under the Goſpel: yet the old Covenant was a Covenant of grace, which all muſt needs grant, unleſſe they thinke that the Patriarks, Prophets, and that holy nation of the Iews were a graceleſſe people out of favour with God, either not at all ſaved, or ſaved by workes. (For there is no way to be ſaved, but by grace or workes; and no ſalvation by grace, but in a Covenant of grace) But I hope you will not be ſo blaſphemous as to ſay this.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If the old Covenant ſtood not by faith (to uſe your phraſe) and circumciſion of the heart, how is it that God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth circumciſion of the heart, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.6. and living by faith, <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.4. and the Prophets call upon the people for circumciſion of the heart, <hi>Ier.</hi> 4.4. and for faith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 7. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20. and that the Apoſtle ſhews, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. that under the old Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant the godly were famous for their faith? Were thoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of God, exhortations of the Prophets, and practiſe of thoſe Worthies ſpoken of concerning faith and circumciſion of the hart, more then was comprehended in the Covenant under which Gods people at that time were?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, whereas you ſay the Church of the Goſpel doth ſtand on faith and circumciſion of the heart: Is your meaning that there is no Church of the Goſpel, but all that are therein, and profeſſed and acknowledged members thereof, are indued with faith and circumciſion of heart? If ſo; experience of the Scripture, and all Chriſtian Churches, will confute you; ſith ſtill chaffe is mingled with graine, tares with wheat; the children of the wicked one, with the children of the kingdome. Or is your meaning that faith and circumciſed hearts, is required of all in the Church of the Goſpel; and is truly in thoſe that are internall and living members of the ſame? This is granted, and may be ſaid as truly of the Church of the Iewes; and therefore this can make no difference being common to both.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Can you tell what you meane when you ſay, That the old Covenant ſtood onely by nature, and circumciſion of the fleſh? I cannot tell how you are to be interpreted but one of theſe three waies: Either, firſt, that this Covenant was grounded on
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:111961:31"/> nature. Or ſecondly, that it promiſed onely naturall or temporall bleſſings. Or thirdly, that it was made with all and onely the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall ſeed of <hi>Abraham:</hi> all which are groſſe and notorious er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, openly croſſing the Scriptures. For if you meane that this Covenant was grounded in nature, this is falſe: for God choſe <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> of free grace and love above all other peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>Ioſh.</hi> 4. <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.7, &amp;c. neither did they differ in nature from others. Or ſecondly, if you meane that God onely required of them outward circumciſion and cutting off the naturall foreskin, and promiſed only naturall and temporall bleſſings; this opinion is fitter to be abhorred, then confuted. Or thirdly, if you meane, that to be of the naturall ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and to be circumciſed in the fleſh, was ſufficient and neceſſary for being in that Covenant, ſo that their being in Covenant conſiſted in being the naturall ſeed of <hi>Abraham;</hi> this is as falſe: for firſt, Were not many Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelytes joyned with the Iſraelites in the ſame Covenant? ſo that to be of <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed was not neceſſary. Secondly, Did not they want circumciſion in the wilderneſſe fourty yeares, and yet remaine in Covenant. Thirdly, Did not <hi>Iſhmael</hi> and <hi>Eſau</hi> grow out of Covenant, though the ſeed of <hi>Abraham;</hi> and ſo ten Tribes ceaſed from being Gods people long before the old Covenant was antiquated; and did not the Prophets ſhew that Legall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations were nothing worth without ſinceritie?</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, though the outward cleanſings and ceremonies of the Law have ceaſed, and ſo that outward &amp; faederall holineſſe be at an end: yet there is an outward and faederall holineſſe of the new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, whereby Chriſtians are diſtinguiſhed from other people. They have their outward Baptiſme and the Lords Supper, prayer in the Name of Chriſt alone, the Word, and profeſſion of the Goſpel, by which they are diſtinguiſhed from unbeleevers. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.41.42. There are reckoned up: firſt, Baptiſme: ſecondly, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles Doctrine: thirdly, Fellowſhip, or Communion with the faithfull: fourthly, breaking Bread: and fifthly, Prayers: as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctive markes of the Church, by which it then was, and to this day is diſtinguiſhed from all other ſocieties whatſoever. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.12. There is a diſtinction expreſſed of thoſe that were within the Church, or Covenant, and members of the Courch, and thoſe that were without; whereof theſe were not ſubject to the judgement or cenſure of the Church, thoſe were. But how are theſe diſtinguiſhed? (that the Church may neither goe beyond,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:111961:32"/> nor neglect her office within, her bounds) By inward holineſſe? that none ſees but God, and each mans owne conſcience; and therefore cannot be a note of diſtinction unto men that cannot diſcern the heart. By outward holineſſe of life? Not ſo; for ſome of thoſe that were within, were guilty of more groſſe profaneneſſe then thoſe that were without, as in the ſame Chap. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.1. and 11. Therefore there muſt be ſome note of diſtinction, or fae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derall holineſſe, by which thoſe that were wicked in heart, and life, and yet Saints by calling, and members of the Church, and ſo under the Churches juriſdiction, might be diſcerned (from them that were without) and ſo ſubjected to the Churches cenſure, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.11, 12, 13.</p>
                  <p>Yet you ſay further. <q rend="inline">There is now onely the new Covenant, which is a covenant of grace and ſalvation, and brings certaine ſalvation to all thoſe that rightly enter into it; which is onely by faith. Hence it is ſaid, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.47. That the Lord added to the Church daily ſuch as ſhould be ſaved.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is as true that the old Covenant made with the Iewes, was a covenant of grace and ſalvation, which brought cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſalvation to all thoſe that rightly entered into it, and that it was onely by faith.<note place="margin">Heb. 11.</note> And as for the Scripture you cite, it is ſaid indeed, That the Lord added to the Church ſuch as ſhould be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. But it is not ſaid, onely ſuch as ſhould be ſaved were added to the Church; or that all thoſe who were added to the Church were ſaved.</p>
                  <p>You proceed: <q rend="inline">And that the holineſſe of children is not meant of any holineſſe in relation to any Church-covenant will appeare further by theſe reaſons. Firſt, that which is an effect of regeneration is not brought to paſſe by generation (though the parents be holy.) But to be of the covenant or kingdome, is the proper effect of regeneration, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.3. without which none can ſee it, (much leſſe be of it) or enter into it. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it cannot be brought to paſſe by generation, though the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents be holy.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> We ſay not (neither can it follow from our grounds) that the children of Chriſtian parents are in covenant with God by generation, but by vertue of Gods gracious promiſe, and from the nature of the covenant of grace; wherein God is pleaſed to accept parents together with their children for his. Secondly, to be of, or in the covenant outwardly (of which being in covenant
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:111961:32"/> we ſpeak, and which is ſufficient to make an externall member of the Church, and give right unto the outward ſeales) you can never prove to be the proper effect of regeneration, untill you have proved that all thoſe who were baptized by <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt, and the Apoſtles, and ſo admitted into the covenant as members of the Church, were truly regenerate; which to hold, were to contradict the Scripture.</p>
                  <p>Your ſecond reaſon is this: <q rend="inline">Secondly, contradictions cannot be the effect of one and the ſame covenant, in one and the ſelfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame reſpect. But for one parent to be a beleever, that is of the Church, when the other parent is not, to produce an holy ſeed that is in covenant, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14. and for the other parents to be one a Iew, the other a Babylonian; the one a member of the Church, the other not; to produce an unholy ſeed that is out of covenant, and to be put away both wiſe and all borne by her, as <hi>Ezr.</hi> 10.3. is a contradiction in one and the ſelfeſame reſpect; and therefore cannot be the effect of one and the ſelfeſame co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Not to examine the forme of this Argument, nor to ſtand upon the ſtrangeneſſe of your expreſſions: I conceive I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend what you would ſay, and anſwer. It is no contradiction for the ſame covenant to require that the Iewes ſhould caſt away their Babyloniſh wives, and the children which they had by them as unholy, and out of covenant: and yet allow the Primitive Chriſtians, their retaining of their yoke-fellowes; (though unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers; in hope that they might be brought within the covenant, and wonne unto Chriſt) and the retaining of their children, as being already in covenant and holy. I ſay here is no contradiction, for here is not the ſame reſpect, which is neceſſary in contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Firſt, the Iewes were forbidden to take wives of any, but of <hi>Abrahams,</hi> ſeed and their owne Tribe. Chriſtians are not tied to any Tribe for their yoke-fellowes; which hinders not but the covenant was the ſame with us and them, though ſome circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances varied. Secondly, the Iewes took Babyloniſh women; (for I will not contend about the name Babylonian, but give you leave to call theſe ſtrange wives Babylonians) after they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves were in covenant with God; which made their marriage with them altogether unlawfull, and their ſeed an unholy, off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring. But thoſe <hi>Corinthians</hi> to whom <hi>Paul</hi> writeth, were married before their calling into covenant with God, as your ſelfe
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:111961:33"/> write. 2. <hi>Part. pag.</hi> 10. And after marriage the one was called to the faith, the other remained unconverted, as may appeare, <hi>verſ.</hi> 20.21.24.27. ſo that their former marriage being lawfull in it ſelfe, and not forbidden of God: (but rather approved, for marriage even among infidels, as well as eating and drinking is Gods ordinance, neceſſary for the due conſervation of the world) and it not being the unbeleeving yoke-fellows fault that his yoke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fellow is an unbeleever; the unbeleevers ſinne ſhall not prejudice the beleever, to hinder their poſteritie from the priviledge of faederall holineſſe.</p>
                  <q>Thirdly, you gather from <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.48. that conſidering the Iewes Church-State from whence this ſucceſſive holyneſſe and being in Covenant, is concluded to come, doth not admit in any conſideration of any lawfull being of parents, the one a member of the Church, the other not, to produce a lawfull ſeed within the old Covenant; that then ſuch a thing in the new Covenant can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be lawfully concluded from that rule.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> That ſcripture <hi>Exod.</hi> 14.48. doth not neceſſarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, that both parents whoſe male children ſhould be circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, ſhould become Proſelytes, and ſubmit themſelves to Gods Covenant. It was ſufficient that the man who had principall Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and power to diſpoſe of his children, ſhould circumciſe his male children, though his wife ſhould refuſe to become a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelyte; (for ought that can be gathered from that or any other ſcripture) or the Proſelyte wife (if either ſhe ſhould be forſaken of her husband, or become a widdow, or be permitted of her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band to diſpoſe of her children, though he were never converted) might have given up her ſelfe and her family to the God of Iſraell by circumciſing her males, for it is ſaid the ſtranger (not his yoke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fellow, or both the parents) ſhall circumciſe his males. So that your reaſons (being diſproved) prove nothing.</p>
                  <p>You bring us in objecting <q rend="inline">They are termed holy, and ſo to be eſteemed: to which you anſwer, So were the unbeleeving Iewes, when they were broken off, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.16. and ſo is the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleeving wife, and yet neither of them to be baptized, for their being termed holy: and therefore neither children for their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing termed holy.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Neither are the unbeleeving Iewes called holy as unbeleiving, for the Apoſtles calls thoſe Iewes an holy lumpe and holy branches (not that were rejected through unbeleefe, but)
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:111961:33"/> that had been, and were to be converted to the faith and ſaved, as is apparent by the coherence: for whom he calls holy here, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.16. he ſpeaks of their fulneſſe (or full and generall converſion) <hi>verſ.</hi> 12. and <hi>v.</hi> 15. he ſpeakes of their converſion which ſhalbe life from the dead, and ſaith that they ſhalbe ſaved, <hi>v</hi> 26. So that it is evident that he calls the Iewes holy, not in reſpect of the unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers which were broken off and diſcovenanted; but of their holy anceſtors, and thoſe whoſe fulneſſe ſhould be a glorious inrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Gentiles, whoſe receiving ſhould be life from the dead, and who ſhould be ſaved and obtaine mercy. And ſo they are call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed holy, as a people conſidered for the future to be taken again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Covenant, and to have right to the ſeale of the Covenant.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Neither is the unbeleeving wife called holy in this place, indeed ſhe is ſaid to be ſanctified to the husband, ſo that he hath an holy and comfortable uſe of her as of other temporall bleſſings: But to be ſanctified for ſuch an uſe or to ſuch a perſon, differeth farre from being holy.</p>
                  <q>You bring us in here demanding, what holyneſſe then is meant to be in children; and anſwer, not that holyneſſe which accompanies faith, and that only is availeable, to the admittance unto the ſtate of the goſpell, and to have right to baptiſme.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> Becauſe you have a good faculty, in repeating the ſame things againe and againe, and denying without proofe whatſoever makes againſt you; I will be content to caſt away ſome more time in anſwering you, though the ſame for ſubſtance that hath been ſaid; and reply: If you meane that holyneſſe which accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny faith, vertuall or actuall, is only available to internall admittance into the ſtate of the Goſpell, ſo as to be made living and reall members of the Church: we aſſent to this aſſertion. But the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is not now; who is a true and ſpirituall Member of the Church, and infalliblely admitted to the ſpirituall and ſaving bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits that Chriſt hath purchaſed for his Church? But who is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Member and may be admitted to the outward ſeale?

                     <q rend="inline">Wheras you goe about largly to ſhew, That in the ſtate of the Iewes, and old Covenant ſome were faederally and outwardly holy, and ſome uncleane: But now that all ſuch diſtinctions are taken away, and that the Apoſtle now meant not any ſuch holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,

Neither doth your long diſcourſe or many abuſed ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures prove any thing to the contrary. To repeat what was ſaid before. Whence was the Church of the Corinthians holy, or a Congreation of ſaints, (ſith there were ſo many really profane and carnall amongſt them) but from federall holyneſſe, by which they were diſtinguiſhed from them that were without; though ſome in the Church were more notorious for vice, then thoſe that were without? whence were the Hebrews called holy brethren, but becauſe they were partakers of the heavenly calling; though ſome were ſo faſtned to the Ceremonies,<note place="margin">Heb 3.2.</note> and inclined to backſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that the Apoſtle uſeth ſharp and ſevere language towards them <hi>ch.</hi> 6.10. and 12? How is it ſaid that they had been ſanctified by the blood of the Covenant, that afterwards trampled on the Sonne of God by apoſtaſy, accounting the blood of the Covenant profane, and doing deſpite to the ſpirit of grace: if men may not in the ſtate of the Goſpell, have a federall holyneſſe, without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward holyneſſe that accompanies the new creature and ſaving faith? So 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9.10. the Apoſtle calls the Chriſtians to whom he wrote, a choſen generation, a royall prieſthood, an holy nation, a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar people, a people of God, that had obtained mercy. Muſt we think that all theſe (to whom <hi>Peter</hi> wrote) were undoubtedly indued with true faith, and holyneſſe that accompanies the new creature; ſo that there was no hypocrite amongſt them? that we have no ground for. How then are theſe glorious titles beſtowed upon them all?

                  </p>
                  <q>You proceed bringing us in objecting and ſaying, that all that were baptized by the Apoſtles themſelves were not ſaved, therefore what you anſwered to our objection, <hi>viz.</hi> that [that availes to baptiſme, which availes to juſtification and ſalvation] is not ſo. To this you anſwer by diſtinguiſhing between the rule which is infallible, &amp; the judgments of men which are falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and may be deceived in applying the rule; yet it followes not but that the rule being of God, is ſtill as infallible as God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. For all that beleeve ſhall be ſaved, which is true as God himſelf is true: but all who are judged by beleevers to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers, doe not beleeve; and therefore are not ſaved. This fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling therefore is not in the rule, but in their judgements that are but men.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> To what purpoſe is it, to ſay, this is an infallible and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall rule, Whoſoever beleeves ſhall be ſaved: unleſſe you prove the other, that is in queſtion. <hi>viz.</hi> that ſaving faith is the only rule of Baptiſme, and that none might be baptized, but they that did actually beleeve, with the faith that accompanies the new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and that this rule is true as God is true? which yet I conceive you will not be ſo bold as to ſay (which unleſſe you ſay, you ſay nothing to purpoſe.) For hence it would follow, that all whom <hi>Iohn</hi> and the Diſciples, &amp;c. regularly baptized, had true faith, and conſequently were ſaved, that they failed, yea were raſh and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous and ſinned grievouſly (as going beyond commiſſion) when they baptized any hypocrite; that ſuch an one after he came to repentance, muſt neceſſarily be baptized againe; for his former baptiſme was applied beſide the rule, and ſo was a falſe baptiſme. Yea if faith be the rule both of baptiſme and juſtification alike, it will follow that as all and only beleevers were juſtified, and all and only the juſtified were beleevers: So all and only the faithfull
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:111961:35"/> muſt be baptized, and all and only the baptized are faithfull, and conſequently whoſoever is baptized is a beleever and a juſtified perſon, and whoſoever is not baptized is neither beleever nor juſtified. But to leave theſe abſurd conſequences that neceſſarily follow upon your abſurd opinion; It is evident that God never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed ſaving faith to be the rule of baptiſme, by which his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters ſhould be directed in adminiſtring baptiſme. For it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for a Miniſter to know infallibly whether another ſaving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beleeveth, and ſo whether he may baptize him according to the rule (if faith be the rule.) That cannot be a rule to us to worke by, which we muſt neceſſarily be ignorant of. God never ordained ſuch an uncertaine, yea incomprehenſible rule for his ſervants to worke by.</p>
                  <q>You proceed. But in baptizing of Infants the caſe is farre o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, yea quite contrary, who will or can faile in judging an Infant to be an Infant.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> There is no more danger of failing in judging an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant to be an Infant, then in judging a man to be a man. But there may be failing in judging an Infant to be truly and really holy and in Covenant, though all the children of Chriſtian parents are called holy: aſwell as there might be failing in judging this or that man in the Corinthian Church to be a ſaint indeed; though the whole Church were called ſaints. For as the Apoſtles did according to the rule of charity, judge men to be beleevers, and ſo baptized them, when they made a profeſſion of faith, and did not manifeſtly diſcover the contrary; though afterwards many proved other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe: So we are to judge Infants of Chriſtian parents to be holy, and ſo within Covenant, and to be baptized, becauſe Gods word teſtifies that they are holy, (and neither your ſhifts and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſticall evaſions, nor all the policie of Satan can diſprove it) though afterwards ſome of them are proved to have been only outwardly, not inwardly in Covenant.</p>

And the reaſon of this holineſſe, ariſeth not here from any rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they had to the Iewiſh State, not from any Church cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; but meerely from Gods firſt inſtitution of marriage in the creation, and his then providing one woman for one man; and which therefore is of univerſall concernment to all mankind, by the law of creation.</q>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> No ſuch thing plainly appeareth, as you would beare men in hand. For the ſcope of the Prophet in that of <hi>Malachi,</hi> ſeemes to be this, which in the 16. <hi>verſ.</hi> he concludes; <hi>viz.</hi> that God hates putting away, that is, divorcement; whereby the Iſraelites alienated their owne wives that were Iſraelites, that they might marry ſtrangers: and this he proves by divers rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, to be odious before God. Firſt, becauſe by this meanes they prophaned the holineſſe of the Lord, in breaking his cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, by putting away their owne wives, that were Iſraelites; and marrying the daughters of ſtrange gods; <hi>viz.</hi> heatheniſh
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:111961:36"/> wives, which God in his covenant had forbidden: by which meanes they would ſoone grow out of covenant, and ceaſe to be an holy people, <hi>verſ.</hi> 11. Secondly, becauſe by this meanes they cauſed the Altar of the Lord to be covered with teares ſo that no ſacrifices were acceptable, (which ſhould have beene offered in joy) becauſe the poore ſorrowfull wives that had been put away, could not but teſtifie before the Altar the ſorrow for the wrong that had been done unto them, <hi>verſ.</hi> 13. Thirdly, becauſe in ſo doing they dealt treacherouſly againſt the wife of their youth, which was the husbands companion, and the wife of his cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, <hi>verſ.</hi> 14. Fourthly, becauſe God had made them one, <hi>verſ.</hi> 15. In the firſt inſtitution of marriage appointing that two onely ſhould be made one fleſh by marriage, appointing alſo that they ſhould be of one ſtock, <hi>viz.</hi> of the Tribe of Iſrael of one Religion, <hi>viz.</hi> worſhippers of the true God of <hi>Abraham,</hi> inclining by his ſpeciall providence theſe couples to make choyce of one another. So that now for them to divorce their wives, is to caſt away part of themſelves. In all theſe reſpects it may be ſaid that God made them one, <hi>viz.</hi> in regard of the firſt inſtitution of marriage, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of lineage, Religion, their mutuall choice one of another, whereby they became one; and in regard of the nature of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, which is to make one man, and one woman no more two, but one fleſh. And though God had the reſt of the ſpirit, that is, the diſpoſition of all perſons, and the inclination of their hearts, in his power; yet as to <hi>Adam</hi> he gave but one wife, ſo to theſe that are here reproved he gave to each of them but one wife, with whom their ſeverall husbands ſhould become one; inclining their ſpirits at their firſt choice, to mutuall and conjugall affection one to another: though it was in his power, to have given them o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yoke-fellows, if it had ſeemed fit to him. Therefore they are bidden to take heed to their ſpirits, <hi>verſ.</hi> 15. &amp; 16. that is, looke to their hearts that they ſhould not wander after adulterous luſts. Fifthly, the fifth Reaſon or Argument, to ſhew that this putting away was odious to God, which the Prophet brings is: Becauſe God therefore made them one, as in other forenamed reſpects, ſo principally in Religion, (for that he ſpeaks principally, if not onely, of this, appears in that he complains of marrying the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a ſtrange god) to the end that he might ſeek a godly ſeed, or ſeed of God: that is,<note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </note> that there might ſucceſſively proceed from them, a ſeed in covenant with God: whereas otherwiſe
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:111961:37"/> the holy ſeed would be ſtained, and God provoked, to diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant them, and their poſteritie, ſo many as ſhould marry ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latreſſes. This ſeemes to be the meaning and ſumme of this Scripture, whereon I have ſtood the longer, becauſe it is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what obſcure. But howſoever <hi>A. R.</hi> will gather that the godly ſeed here, or holy ſeed, as he will metaphraſe it, muſt needs ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie a ſeed onely legitimate, or borne in lawfull matrimony; and ſo conclude that no more is meant by holy, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. His ground I can ſee to be none other, but becauſe God is ſaid to make one ſeeking an holy ſeed. But I anſwer: Firſt, that this place is too farre fetcht to gather clearly therefrom, that all children begotten in lawfull matrimony are an holy ſeed; and that unholy ſeed is ſo called in reſpect of the firſt inſtitution onely of marriage, which is the ground of the marriage of Heathens and Infidels. Secondly, I have ſhewed that in divers other reſpects, God may be as truly ſaid to have made them one; as in reſpect of the firſt inſtitution of marriage, which may as pertinently to this place, and agreeably to the ſcope of the H. G. &amp; to the truth it ſelf have place here. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I ſhewed that the ſcope of this Scripture imports that oneneſſe in Religion muſt needs here be meant (whether with or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the other ſignifications, I ſay not) which quite overthrowes his ground; for if unitie in the true Religion muſt needs concurre in parents, (at leaſt as the caſe ſtood with them) to make an holy ſeed, then they that are of a falſe religion cannot produce an holy ſeed, let their marriage be never ſo lawfull. Fourthly, though I ſhould grant (which yet you can never prove, nor will I yeeld) that this making one to ſeek a godly ſeed, were to be referred onely to Gods firſt inſtitution of marriage: yet will not your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion at all follow, Therefore all children borne in lawfull ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony of what Religion ſo even, are an holy ſeed. For if God at firſt intending to have a holy ſeed from <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> and ſo ſucceſſively, that ſhould be in covenant with him, appointed that one man ſhould have but one woman; and ſet down this as a law of nature to be obſerved by their poſteritie; to the end that they ſhould not pollute themſelves with promiſcuous copulation, and ſhould be diſcerned from other people; as by other pious conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, ſo by their chaſtitie in marriage, and avoyding of polygamy and wicked divorces: will it hence follow that what parents ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever avoyd polygamy and live chaſtly in marriage, generate a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly feed? in no wiſe: For that a people may be Gods people, and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:111961:37"/> their ſeed a godly ſeed, or ſeed of God, many things are required, as that they be worſhippers of the true God, that they be no ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters, no witches, blaſphemers, murderers, &amp;c. and divers things more both affirmative and negative, are required in the covenant. Whereof if a man performe one or two, he is not forthwith in covenant, nor his ſeed a godly ſeed. Beſides, what an abſurd collection is it which you make hence, that all legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates or not baſtards, are a holy or godly ſeed? for now you that pleaded againſt the holineſſe of Chriſtians children, will have all children, though of Turkes, Indians, and moſt groſſe Idolaters to be holy, ſo that they be borne in lawfull matrimony, which you grant may be (and it is plaine commonly is) among the heathen. You ſay, <q rend="inline">This that is here ſpoken of a godly ſeed is of univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall concernment to all mankind by the law of creation.</q> But I anſwer.

                  <p>You adde. <q rend="inline">In the ſame ſenſe is that to be taken, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.4. Marriage is honourable in all, but whoremongers and adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers God will judge. And gather hence, if marriage be honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, &amp; the bed undefiled; then the iſſue of the bed muſt needs be undefiled, that is, cleane and holy: on the other ſide, the iſſue of unlawfull conjunctions are unclean, illegitimate, and baſtards. Now this holineſſe or unholineſſe of children, proceeds not from the holineſſe or unholineſſe of parents: but from the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full or unlawfull conjunction of parents, in the begetting of
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:111961:38"/> children; for the Apoſtle in this place ſpeakes of all men uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Let any indifferent man judge, whether this be not an uncleane, illegitimate, and ſpurious interpretation of, and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing concluſions from the Scripture. For firſt; What comfort or reſolution had this beene in the ſcrupulous parent, to tell him that his children were holy, that is, legitimate and no baſtards, but legitimates becauſe they were begotten in lawfull matrimony that had beene contracted before converſion; whereas by your interpretation of theſe Scriptures, if they had continued ſtill un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted both of them, their children had beene as holy, that is, legitimate and no baſtards? Secondly, how can this place [Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage is honourable in all, &amp;c. and the bed undefiled] be underſtood of all men univerſally (as you ſay) <hi>viz.</hi> unbeleevers as well as beleevers?<note place="margin">Tit. 1.15.</note> When the Apoſtle ſaith: Vnto the pure, all things are pure; but unto them that are defiled and unbeleeving, is nothing pure, but even their mind and conſcience is defiled; how can the marriage bed then be undefiled to ſuch? It is evident therefore, (that we make not the Spirit of God contradict it ſelfe) that the univerſall note (all men) is to be reſtrained to the ſubject matter, <hi>viz.</hi> all ſorts of beleevers, (for to ſuch he wrote) of what qualitie, condition or calling ſoever.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, But I pray you ſee (and if you will not, let others con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider) how all this while in interpreting this Scripture, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14. and wreſting, wiredrawing, and pulling in (as it were, <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torto collo</hi>) other Scriptures which you would force to favour your interpretation, you have directly and manifeſtly contradicted the Apoſtle, and corrupted the Text. The Apoſtle tells the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving yoke-fellows, that their children are holy, though their yoke-fellows were unbeleevers: becauſe they are ſanctified to them; (<hi>viz.</hi> by their faith) you ſay, therefore the children are ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe their matrimonie was lawfull: If the Apoſtles mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing were that which you would have it, he ſhould have ſaid, You were lawfully married, therefore are your children holy. But he ſaith, The unbeleever is ſanctified by (or to) the beleever, elſe were your children uncleane, let their marriage be never ſo law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. <hi>Paul</hi> gathers the holineſſe of children from grounds peculiar to the faithfull: <hi>viz.</hi> the faith and being in covenant at leaſt of one of the parents, ſhewing plainly that were it not for this, the children muſt needs be uncleane. You would draw it from
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:111961:38"/> grounds common to Infidels, <hi>viz.</hi> lawfull matrimony; affirming that whoſoever is borne of parents (though infidels) lawfully married, is holy in the Apoſtles ſenſe. Thus when men ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to maintain errours, they are not afraid nor aſhamed plainly to contradict the Spirit of God.</p>
                  <q>You have ſomewhat further which you call an objection: It ſeems then that the holines here of the children ariſeth not from the holineſſe or faith of the parents; but meerly from the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full marriage and conjunction of the parents; and then you an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer: It is even ſo, and goe on to repeat what you have ſaid, and adde ſuch like ſtuffe not worth reading.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is even falſe (though you dictate it as <hi>è cathedra,</hi> or <hi>è tripode</hi>) and a manifeſt contradicting of plain Scripture, as hath beene before demonſtrated. Your two next objections doe not concern us; and therefore I paſſe them by.</p>
                  <p>Yet one more objection you bring us in making: Have the children of beleevers no more priviledge then the children of Heathens, Turks, and Infidels? you anſwer. In reſpect of the Covenant of grace and ſalvation, none at all; and bring thoſe Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.7, 8. <hi>Act.</hi> 10.34, 35. to ſhew that the Covenant of grace cometh not by any naturall birth, but by a new birth. Onely their priviledge (you ſay) is in reſpect of the meanes of ſalvation; for beleeving parents may be a means to bring their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to the knowledge and faith of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> What Chriſtian heart doth not abhorre this aſſertion as being directly contrary to the tenour of Gods Covenant, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. (of which more hereafter) and repugnant to Gods gracious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes frequently inculcated in Scripture, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.5, 6. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.39. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 59.21? Doth not this ſtrike at a maine pillar of a Chriſtians comfort grounded on thoſe precious promiſes? ſo that by this tenet, if the children of Chriſtian parents die before they be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of the outward meanes of ſalvation, or their parents be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from them before they come to yeares of diſcretion; they muſt be parted with as the children of Turkes or Infidels, as being out of the ſtate of ſalvation, as being in a loſt and hopeleſſe condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as having no right to the Covenant, notwithſtanding all the gracious promiſes that God hath made to the faithfull to be their God, and the God of their ſeed, to ſhew mercy to their poſteritie, even to thouſands, that the promiſes doe belong unto them and their children, that his word and Spirit ſhall abide on
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:111961:39"/> their ſeed, and their ſeeds ſeed. Let men judge whether the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of lies can ſpeake more contradictorily to Scripture, for the extenuating of Gods rich grace, and daſhing the comfort of Gods people.</p>
                  <p>Thus have I vindicated the ground of my third argument. Yet notwithſtanding all ſhifts we ſee this truth remaines firme, that the children of Chriſtian parents are faederally holy, and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church, and ſo have right to the ſeale of admiſſion into the Church.</p>

                     </note> To thoſe that are in Covenant with God, the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or ſeale which God hath inſtituted to repreſent and ſeale admiſſion into Covenant, is to be adminiſtred, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.10, 11. <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.48.</p>
                  <p>But children of beleeving parents are in Covenant with God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7. <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.48. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 59.21. Therefore children of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving parents are to be admitted to the ſeale of entrance into the Covenant, which now is baptiſme in the time of the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>For the confirmation, and explication of the former propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I conceive it is hardly queſtioned but that when God hath made a Covenant with his people, and appointed a ſeale to ſignifie and repreſent admiſſion into the ſame; then the ſeale or ſigne belongs to thoſe which have entred into Covenant under what kinde of adminiſtration ſoever the Covenant be diſpenſed. So <hi>Philip</hi> reaſons, If thou beleeve with all thine heart, thou maiſt be baptized. So <hi>Peter,</hi> Can any one forbid water that theſe ſhould not be baptized, &amp;c. For actuall faith, at leaſt in profeſſion, was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to thoſe that at firſt entered into the new covenant, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the ſign or ſeale thereof; to wit, baptiſme: as well as it was neceſſary to <hi>Abraham</hi> who entered firſt into the old Covenant which was ſealed by Circumciſion, though actuall faith was not required of his poſteritie as neceſſarie to their being in Covenant. Neither for ought that I ſee doth the Adverſarie deny this propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition. Yet if it be queſtioned, it is fully proved in <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 17.10, 11. with whom we read that God firſt made an expreſſe and formall Covenant, and inſtituted a ſigne or ſeale to ſignifie enterance into that Covenant, and diſtinguiſh the Church from other Societies. And this was not required of <hi>Abraham</hi> alone and his family: but of all foreiners alſo, that ſo ſoone as they ſhould enter into covenant, they ſhould have this ſigne and ſeale of admittance,, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.48. And ſtill in the New-Teſtament as
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:111961:39"/> ſoone as men had given evidence of their entrance into the new Covenant, they were baptized.</p>
                  <p>Now here is to be noted, that the Covenant of grace was ever one and the ſame for ſubſtance; though for the manner it have beene variouſly diſpenſed, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. through the whole Chapter, and <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.8. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.5. as ſhall be ſhewed (God willing) more fully hereafter.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, before <hi>Abrahams</hi> time we read not of any diſtinct and full manifeſtation of the Covenant of grace expreſly in the termes of a Covenant, nor of any gathering of a Church out of the world, as a diſtinct body whereunto the faithfull were to joyn themſelves; nor of any viſible ſeale or ſacred ſigne of admiſſion into Covenant with God; though God had a people in covenant from the beginning, yet the covenant was more ſparingly, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurely, and implicitly revealed, and no diſtinctive outward note of entrance into covenant (that we read of) appointed.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, ſince the Covenant was made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the ſigne of circumciſion inſtituted, in the old and new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, there hath ſtill beene a ſolemne ſigne or Sacrament of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, to which all that were in Covenant had right; ſo that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> that was the firſt expreſſe Covenanter is called, the father of the faithfull, or of thoſe that were in covenant with God; and is to be imitated by the faithfull in all thoſe things that are eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to the covenant.</p>
                  <p>For the Aſſumption. The words of the Text are cleare. Firſt, that God made the Covenant with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7. Secondly, that we ſhould not thinke that that externall covenant belonged onely to thoſe that imitated his faith, it is made with his naturall ſeed, all that ſhould be begotten of him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.10. Even all that ſeed wherein God promiſed to make <hi>Abraham</hi> fruitfull, ſhould ſo farre be in Covenant, as to have right to the onward ſigne, untill they ſhould fall away from the outward covenant by wilfull Apoſtaſie, <hi>verſ.</hi> 6, 7, 10. Thirdly, that you may ſee this was not peculiar to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his poſteritie alone that proceeded from his loines; the ſame is commanded concerning his ſervants borne in his houſe, or bought with his money, that the males who onely were capable, ſhould receive the ſeale of the Covenant, <hi>verſ.</hi> 12, 13. Fourthly, that you may know that this did not belong onely to <hi>Abrahams</hi> family, but was a thing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all that ſhould enter into covenant, <hi>viz.</hi> that their children
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:111961:40"/> ſhould be acknowledged to be in Covenant alſo, by having the ſeale of entrance adminiſtred to them; ſee <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.48. Laſtly, that we may underſtand that this was not proper to the old cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in the Legall diſpenſation, but common to the Covenant of grace under whatſoever diſpenſation, as well Evangelicall as Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall; a promiſe of the ſame priviledge is made to beleeving pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, even from the time of the Goſpel, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 50.20, 21. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.26, 27.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">A. R.</note>Now I come to your anſwers, which is: <hi>That neither Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham nor his ſeed was circumciſed, becauſe the Covenant was made with him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Who denies this? or what is this to the purpoſe? we know that God might have made a Covenant without a ſeale, if it had pleaſed him. They were circumciſed, becauſe God did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute circumciſion for a ſeale, and appointed it to thoſe that were admitted into Covenant. The faithfull we know were in covenant before <hi>Abrahams</hi> time; though there be no formall or full expreſſion of the covenant, nor of any ſigne or Sacrament of entering thereinto.</p>
                  <q>You adde a reaſon of your aſſertion. For the covenant was made with <hi>Abraham</hi> above twenty yeares before circumciſion was inſtituted, as may appeare by comparing <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.2. &amp; 3. with <hi>Gen.</hi> 16.3. &amp; 17.25.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> No ſuch thing appeareth in the places cited. It appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth indeed that God had made a promiſe to <hi>Abraham</hi> long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of making him a great Nation, and bleſſing him; but there is no word of the Covenant, or that God would be a God to him and his ſeed, in thoſe places before, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.2. (though we know that <hi>Abraham</hi> from his firſt call was in covenant with God; as were <hi>Abel, Enoch, Noah,</hi> and all the faithfull before <hi>Abraham,</hi> as the covenant is generally taken. But here we ſpeake of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant in regard of its expreſſe manifeſtation and ſpeciall admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration, with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and afterward, ſince the inſtitution of a ſeale thereunto.) And it appears that in <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. <hi>verſ.</hi> 2. is the firſt expreſſion of Gods making a covenant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> at which time alſo circumciſion was inſtituted. And if God had made a covenant never ſo long before with <hi>Abraham,</hi> neither he not his ſeed muſt have uſed circumciſion untill God had inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it. But after God had appointed it, all that were in covenant
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:111961:40"/> were to be circumciſed, that were capable, even all males of eight dayes old and upward.</p>
                  <q>You ſay, The covenant was not made with <hi>Abraham</hi> for his being a faithfull man; but for his being ſuch a faithfull man whom the Lord was pleaſed to chuſe and ſet out as a patterne to all beleevers, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.23, 24. and to be a father of many Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.17, 18. and in whoſe ſeed all the Nations of the world ſhould be bleſſed, <hi>Act.</hi> 5.25. &amp; 13.23. to wit, in Chriſt, who was to come of his fleſh.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> We know that the Covenant was not made with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> for his being a faithfull man; neither yet for his being ſuch a faithfull man, &amp;c. as you would have it. But <hi>Abraham</hi> was made by God a faithfull man, and taken into covenant of Gods free grace, that he might be a patterne to future beleevers, and a father of many Nations, &amp;c. <hi>Abrahams</hi> faithfulneſſe ſo qualified, was not the cauſe why God took him into covenant. But <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> faithfulneſſe, acceptance into covenant, and being a patterne of beleevers, a father of many Nations; in whoſe ſeed all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are bleſſed, were effects of Gods good pleaſure, and free grace. Secondly, neither doe thoſe places of Scripture produced by you yeeld the leaſt ſhew of proofe, that <hi>Abraham</hi> was taken into covenant and his ſeed for being ſuch a faithfull man as God was pleaſed to chooſe and ſet out a patterne to all beleevers, &amp;c. Thirdly, ſeeing <hi>Abraham</hi> was taken into covenant, that he might be, or at the moſt, as being (I dare not ſay (with you) for being) ſuch a faithfull man, whom the Lord was pleaſed to chooſe, and ſet out a patterne to all beleevers, and to be a father of many Nations; and in whoſe ſeed all the Nations of the world ſhould be bleſſed: then it is the dutie of all that are beleevers, children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and will be bleſſed in <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, that is, Chriſt, to imitate <hi>Abrahams</hi> example, in laying hold on the covenant for themſelves and their children; and giving them up to God even in their infancie, by requiring the ſeale of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to be adminiſtred unto them, and not to looſe any part of that inheritance that God entayled upon <hi>Abraham</hi> and his children: ſeeing as it hath been proved, it is no peculiar priviledge of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> to have his ſeed in covenant; nor his peculiar dutie to lay hold on the covenant for his children: but the common priviledge and dutie of all the faithfull.</p>
                  <q>You proceed. Therefore though the promiſes were made to
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:111961:41"/> 
                     <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed; yet the conſequence will not follow, that the covenant is likewiſe made with all beleevers and their ſeed; for beleevers onely are the ſeed, and the ſeed onely; and none of them a father in the Goſpel ſenſe, nor any other; ſave onely <hi>Abraham,</hi> to whom and his ſeed the covenant and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes were made.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, If the conſequence will not follow, Becauſe God is the God of <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed; Therefore he is, to all the faithfull, and their ſeed: how is <hi>Abraham</hi> a father of the faithfull and patterne of beleevers? Or how will it follow that <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> performed any dutie, or received any priviledge; Therefore all beleevers ought to doe thoſe duties, may receive thoſe pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges? Secondly, your reaſon that you bring for your deniall of our conſequence, is a bold aſſertion manifeſtly repugnant to plain Scripture: as <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.5.6. Where God having laid downe the ſumme of the covenant, <hi>verſ.</hi> 2. bindes his people to his true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and to avoid Idolatrie, with a promiſe of mercy unto thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of thoſe that ſhould love him, and keepe his commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Now theſe thouſands are meant of the godly mans poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, as appeareth by the Antitheſis of <hi>verſ.</hi> 5. viſiting the ſinnes of the fathers on their children, unto the third and fourth genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp;c. Doth not this promiſe belong to all that are in covenant with God, and are bound to the obedience of the morall Law, and to the pure worſhip of God, and abſtinence from idolatry? ſo <hi>Eſa.</hi> 59. laſt <hi>verſ. Act.</hi> 2.37. What is meant by Gods ſhewing mercy to a thouſand generations, making a covenant that his Spirit, and word ſhall be continued to their ſeed, and ſeeds ſeed, that the promiſe is made to them whom the Lord doth call and their children; but the ſame that God promiſeth unto <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> that he will make a covenant with him and his ſeed; be a God to him and his ſeed? So that this anſwer to your boldly-af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, but never-proved aſſertion, (that to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed onely the promiſe was made) may ſuffice to overthrow the inferences you bring thereupon, and your abſurdities that you would father upon us mingled with divers untruths (as may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to any intelligent Reader) not worth anſwering. Onely that which you lay downe in the beginning: <q rend="inline">For beleevers onely are the ſeed; and in the concluſion, <hi>Abraham</hi> hath not two ſorts of ſeeds in the ſenſe and acceptation of the Goſpel.</q> Vpon which as upon a ground-work of all, your reaſoning is built;
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:111961:41"/> that the rottenneſſe of the foundation being diſcovered, it may appeare how eaſily the ſuperſtruction will come down of it ſelfe. I anſwer therefore:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> We read in the Goſpell or new Teſtament, of three ſorts of <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed: Firſt, Chriſt is called his ſeed, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.16. Secondly, the faithfull of what Nation ſoever are called his ſeed, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.29. Thirdly, thoſe who naturally deſended from his loynes, <hi>Iohn.</hi> 8.37. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.22. And in this laſt kind to be <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, was ſufficient to intreſſe men to the outward Covenant, and the ſeale thereof; and the promiſe was made to <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 17. literally and properly in this laſt ſenſe, not in the firſt or ſecond, as is apparent by the text. For with that ſeed God made the Covenant in <hi>Abraham;</hi> and to that ſeed God became a God, which was to be circumciſed at eight dayes old, in reſpect of the males, &amp; (as you ſay) the females in the males. But the natural iſſue of <hi>Abraham</hi> was to be circumciſed at 8 dayes old, in reſpect of the males, &amp; in them the females: See <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7.10.11.12. for proofe of both propoſitions. Therfore the naturall iſſue of <hi>Abraham,</hi> is the ſeed to which according to the litteral and proper meaning of the Scripture, God promiſes to be a God in Covenant. And ſo it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares to be falſe which you ſay; that beleevers only were the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſith many naturally deſcending from <hi>Abraham,</hi> and circumciſed, and ſo outwardly in Covenant, were unbeleevers.</p>
                  <q>You add that wee ſay, Infants were then members of the Church, and demand when they were caſt out: to which you anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, that they were caſt out when the Iewes Church-ſtate, and old Covenant was abrogate by the comming of Chriſt, and preaching of the Goſpell, and planting of other Churches farre different from that of the Iewes in many reſpects.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> But I hope Gods people are not ſo ſimple as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve your bare words, againſt Gods expreſſe truth, (though you were an Angell from heaven or an Apoſtle,<note place="margin">Gal. 1.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Is this to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance Gods Grace, to extoll the Goſpell and glorifie Ieſus Chriſt? Or rather is it not a tricke of the devill greatly to obſcure, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour the utter extinguiſhing of the glory of Gods grace, the virtue of Chriſts death, the luſtre of the Goſpell, and the comfort of a Chriſtian all at once? They that will hearken to ſuch deceits as theſe, let them make account at the laſt to be cheated of all grounds of comfort in Gods word.<note place="margin">Act. 2.39.</note> Doth not the Apoſtle ſay, the promiſe is to you and your children, and to them that are afarre off, &amp;c. when the Iewes Church-ſtate and old Covenant were ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogated.</p>
                  <p>But let us come to conſider the many reſpects wherein you ſay that the Church of the Goſpell differs from the Iewiſh ſtate or old Covenant, whence you would prove that Infants are now caſt out of Covenant: wherein becauſe you repeat for ſubſtance ſome toyes and fancies of your owne braine, that you have vented be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I will not think it burdenſom to anſwer you, though in ſome things the ſame for ſubſtance that hath been ſaid before.</p>
                  <q>That (you ſay) <hi>viz.</hi> the Iewiſh Church-ſtate and old Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, being conſtituted upon nature and the naturall ſeed of <hi>Abraham.</hi>
                  </q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I pray you, can you tell what you meane when you ſay that the Iewes Church-ſtate was conſtituted upon nature and the naturall ſeed of <hi>Abraham?</hi> I am ſure you ſpeake not according to Scripture (that I ſay not, nor according to ſenſe or reaſon.) As far as I can apprehend, when you ſay it was built upon nature (If you have any meaning in theſe words, and doe not let them fall from you at randome) it muſt be underſtood either, firſt, that nature was the ground &amp; cauſe of this covenant; or ſecondly, that naturall bleſſings were onely beſtowed in this covenant; or third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that this covenant was made onely with the naturall children of <hi>Abraham:</hi> all which are manifeſtly falſe. For firſt, if your meaning be that this covenant was grounded on nature, ſo that nature was the cauſe of it; you muſt either meane the nature of God as contradiſtinguiſh't to his will and good pleaſure: or the nature of <hi>Abraham.</hi> The nature of God was not the cauſe of it,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:111961:42"/> for what God doth by nature (his nature being the cauſe) he doth eternally, neceſſarily, unchangeably, ſo as he cannot but doe it; as to know himſelfe and all things knowable, to love himſelfe. Or if you meane that the nature of <hi>Abraham</hi> was the ground of this covenant, it is as falſe; for there was nothing in <hi>Abraham</hi> by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that put difference between him and others, <hi>Deut.</hi> 7. <hi>Ioſh.</hi> 24. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. Or if you meane God onely beſtowed temporall bleſſings in this covenant, that is palpably and execrably falſe alſo. God was their God in the old covenant, circumciſed their heart to love him, feare him, and obey him, and truſt in him; he gave remiſſion of ſinnes and ſanctification under that Covenant, which were not naturall bleſſings. Or thirdly, if you meane that that Covenant was made with <hi>Abrahams</hi> naturall poſteritie, there is no appearance of truth in it; for bond-men and thoſe that were bought with money, and Proſelytes of any nation or ſtock what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, were admitted into this Covenant, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.</p>
                  <q>You adde. This (to wit, the Chriſtian Church-ſtate) upon grace and the ſpirituall ſeed of <hi>Abraham.</hi>
                  </q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> So was the old Covenant (to uſe your phraſe) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted on grace, Gods free favour was the cauſe of it, and the graces of the Spirit beſtowed as truly under it (though not ſo plentifully, and clearely as now) as theſe phraſes expreſſe:<note place="margin">Gen. 17. Deut. 30. Mal. 2.5.</note> I am God all-ſufficient. I will be thy God. I will circumciſe thy heart, and the heart of thy ſeed, to love the Lord thy God, &amp;c. My Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant was with him of life and peace. Secondly, if you meane by the ſpirituall ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> Ieſus Chriſt the ſeed of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that was to breake the Serpents head,<note place="margin">Gen. 3. Joh. 8. Rev. 13. 1 Tim. 2.</note> in whom the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant was made with our firſt parents fallen; at the ſeeing of whoſe day <hi>Abraham</hi> rejoyced, in whom God promiſes, that all the Nations of the earth ſhould be bleſſed: the old Covenant was made with <hi>Abraham</hi> in him; who is the Lambe ſlaine from the foundation of the world; who is the onely Mediatour between God and man, and by whom alone, <hi>Abraham</hi> and all the faithfull have had communion with God.</p>
                  <q>You adde. That therefore termed Iſrael according to the fleſh, and of the circumciſion of the fleſh, this Iſrael according to the ſpirit and of the circumciſion of the heart, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.28, 29. &amp; 4 6, 7, 8. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.11.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> No ſuch thing appeareth in thoſe Scriptures. Take heed how you falſifie Gods word, would you perſwade men, that God
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:111961:43"/> gave not circumciſion of heart under the old Covenant? that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all were not right Iſraelites that were <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore none were? that becauſe he is not a Iew that is one outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: therefore none under the old covenant were inwardly Iews? becauſe true Chriſtians are circumciſed with a circumciſion with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hands; therefore the Iewes were not circumciſed but onely with hands, not ſpiritually. Let any man examine thoſe Scriptures, and ſee whether from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it can be gathered, that all under the old covenant had onely circumciſion of the fleſh, and that all under the new covenant have circumciſion of the ſpirit. It will appeare to any judicious Reader, that here are two or three notorious falſehoods, with a groſſe perverting of Scripture in this ſhort ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. The firſt: That the Iewiſh Church-ſtate, or old covenant is called Iſrael, according to the fleſh, or circumciſion of the fleſh; but the Goſpel-ſtate Iſrael, according to the ſpirit, or the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion of the heart, (wherein are infolded more untruths then one.) Secondly, that therefore they are ſo called, becauſe that was conſtituted on the naturall ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> &amp;c. The abuſe of Scripture appeares, that theſe Scriptures neither prove the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent, nor ſequele, nor conſequent, neither make any thing for his purpoſe; as if it would not be overtedious to ſtand upon, and needleſſe to any men of judgement, might be ſhewed. But ſuch uttering of falſhoods, and then propping them with Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures to abuſe the ſimple, is ordinary almoſt in every page, and ſometimes frequent in one page, as may appeare by the anſwer, though I have not ſaid ſo much in expreſſe words before; neither ſhould have ſaid ſo now, but that I conſider ſuch is the weakneſſe of ſome Readers, that what they read, if Scripture be brought for proofe thereof, though never ſo impertinently, abuſively, and perverſely, they thinke it muſt goe for currant.</p>
                  <q>Thirdly, that (you ſay) a ſtate of bondmen or ſervants, ſo as in that ſtate; an heire or beleever differed nothing from a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, though he were lord of all, &amp;c. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.7.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> That under the Old Teſtament the Church of the Iews was an heire, yea lord of all: (though in regard of its infancie and immaturitie, nothing differing from a ſervant, as being held un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the tutourſhip of the Law) this I ſay, is ſufficient to prove that the Church of the Iewes, and the Chriſtian Church, is one and the ſame, for ſubſtance, and under the ſame Covenant in all eſſentialls. For all know that a ſonne and heire is the ſame for
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:111961:43"/> ſubſtance and in perſon, at three yeares old, and at thirty; though altered in ſome accidentall priviledges at riper yeares. And hence your fancie of the Iewiſh Church being conſtituted on nature, is quite overthrowne. For if the Iewiſh Church was heire and lord of all, beleevers were then children, though in minoritie and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der tutourſhip. How were they children? not by nature; for Chriſt onely is the Sonne of God by nature; therefore by grace, and ſo they were under a Covenant of Grace. Thus powerfull is the word of truth to overthrow thoſe errours that ignorant men would abuſe, and force it to maintaine, and yet you are not afraid nor aſhamed to father this errour upon Chriſt himſelfe, and would force his words to the Iewes to ſound this way, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8.31. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other your toyes, that you would faſten on him, (which are not worth the examining, unleſſe a man had more time then he knew how well to beſtow) you bring him in ſpeaking thus in the concluſion of your paraphraſe that you make on his words to the Iewes. <q rend="inline">You ſee then how that Covenant of Circumciſion made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and you his naturall ſeed, was to be an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting Covenant in your fleſh; to wit, in me that was to come of your fleſh, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.13.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, is not this notorious preſumption to father ſuch a fancy as this on Chriſt? to call the fleſh of the Iews fore-skinne, Chriſt himſelfe? for that by the fleſh in which Gods covenant was, is meant the fore-skin, wherein God ſet the ſigne and ſeale of his covenant, is apparent by comparing the 10, 11, &amp; 12. <hi>verſes</hi> of <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. together. Secondly, If that were an everlaſting Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant which God made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the Iſraelites; and made with them in Chriſt (though Chriſt was not that fleſh in which circumciſion was made) both which you grant here, and the Scripture plentifully proveth; then certainly was the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant made with the Iewes, and with us, all one for ſubſtance: ſeeing they and we have one Mediatour, and ſeeing the old di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſation of the covenant is abrogated; how was that an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting covenant; but as the ſame covenant is perpetuated now in the Evangelicall diſpenſation of it?</p>
                  <q>But you will have Chriſt give this reaſon; that by the fleſh (wherein the covenant of circumciſion was to be) is meant Chriſt, becauſe Chriſt was to come of their fleſh.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Was he ſo? Was Chriſt to come of the fleſh of ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and Proſelytes, or of all the poſteritie of <hi>Abraham,</hi> which
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:111961:44"/> had the covenant in the fleſh? Did Chriſt come of the fleſh of all that were circumciſed? (which muſt needs follow on this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit) What prodigious opinions doth this mans braine conceive and father on Chriſt?</p>
                  <q>After you come, as you ſay, to ſhut up all thus: That it is apparent that infants of Chriſtian parents cannot warrantably be baptized, untill they manifeſt and declare their faith by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion: as is apparent, firſt, from the doctrine, and practiſe of <hi>Iohn, Matth.</hi> 3.6.8, 9. <hi>Mar.</hi> 1.4. Secondly, of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3, 22. compared with 4.1, 2. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.38.41. and 8.12.36, 37. Thirdly, by the tenour of the commiſſion, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.29. <hi>Mar.</hi> 16.15, 16.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> No ſu h thing is apparent from theſe Scriptures; as is, firſt, ſufficiently ſhewed by the foregoing reaſons. Secondly, by the fore examination of thoſe Scriptures and grounds you build upon. Thirdly, in none of thoſe places doe you finde baptiſme ſo reſtrained to thoſe that profeſſe the faith, that it ſhould be lawfull for none elſe to have it. Fourthly, I adde, if abuſing the Scriptures and inventing and avouching new and monſtrous errours, may make your opinion for which you plead to be apparent truth, then indeed you have made appparent what you ſay, otherwiſe not. Fiftly, though in mine anſwer to that Scripture, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.29. I hope ſufficient hath been ſaid to anſwer all other Scriptures of that kind; yet becauſe ſome put great confidence in that <hi>Mar.</hi> 16.15.16. for this opinion, though it be the ſame for ſubſtance with the other,<note place="margin">Mar. 16.15, 16.</note> I will adde a little in this place, though happily the ſame for ſubſtance that hath beene ſaid. The words of Chriſt are theſe: <hi>Go ye into all the world, and preach the Goſpel unto every creature. He that beleeveth and is baptized, ſhall be ſaved, he that beleeveth not ſhall be damned</hi> To make it appeare that nothing can be gathered to confirme the adverſaries opinion, note theſe foure things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Here our Saviour doth not forbid his Diſciples to baptize any that want actuall faith, or confine baptiſme to beleevers; or expreſſely ſhew who ſhould be baptized, and who not; onely he ſhews who ſhould by ſaved, <hi>viz.</hi> thoſe that beleeve and were baptized; and who ſhould be damned, <hi>viz.</hi> thoſe that beleeved not: ſo that it is ſtrange that men ſhould promiſe to themſelves any patronage for Anabaptiſme from this place. Secondly, If any ſhould ſay, that though here it be not expreſſed that beleevers
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:111961:44"/> onely are to be baptized; yet it may be hence gathered, and is implied from the order and connexion of the words, (He that beleeveth and is baptized) ſo that men muſt beleeve before they be baptized. I adde, ſecondly: That no ſuch thing can be neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily implied by the ſeries of the words, which I prove by this very Text. Firſt, it would by as good conſequence follow, that none ought or can preach the Goſpel, be meanes of working faith, ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptize, or helpe toward ſalvation; but thoſe who have received Apoſtolicall authoritie, and gifts to goe into all the world, and preach unto every creature, for the connexion and order is alike; but no man will yeeld this conſequence. Secondly, by as good and better conſequence you might gather, that none ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved but thoſe that beleeve and are baptized, which is falſe; for whatſoever you hold, I conceive that none but thoſe that are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven over to ſtrong deluſions will hold that all the children of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian parents that die before they come to actuall faith, muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medileſly periſh: and as for the abſolute neceſſitie of baptiſme to ſalvation, if with the Papiſts you hold it, will eaſily be confuted from this Scripture, ſhewing that not want of baptiſme (where it cannot be had, and is not wilfully contemned) but unbeleefe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth. Yet there is as good reaſon for theſe inferences from this place as for that you would imply hence. Or thirdly, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but unbeliefe can be the ground of damnation might as well be concluded hence, as that nothing but faith can be the ground of baptiſme; whereas not onely unbeleife, but every ſinne is dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, and without repentance will bring damnation.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, I anſwer to this Scripture, that though it were granted that the Apoſtles, who were to gather a Church out the unbeleeving world, and take them into Covenant that were out of Covenant, might not baptize any but thoſe who by profeſſing faith tooke hold of the covenant, from which before they were aliens, and their families, who were now received into covenant with them: yet it doth not follow, that the children of parents in covenant (and ſo in Covenant themſelves) ſhould be denied baptiſme; though they want actuall faith: for there is not the ſame reaſon of a Church gathered, and to be gathered: as that latter part, He that beleeveth not ſhall be damned; if it be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of actuall faith, muſt be reſtrained to the preſent time and matter: for to thoſe that were out of Covenant, actuall faith was neceſſary to bring them and theirs within covenant. So that the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:111961:45"/> Gentiles to whom the Apoſtles were to preach, muſt of neceſſity actually beleeve, elſe they could not be ſaved. But this muſt not be extended to all perſons and times: for then it ſhould follow that no child of Chriſtian parents dying before yeares of diſcretion and actuall faith, could be ſaved; which is directly contrary to thoſe Scriptures that ſhew, that God will be a God to the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and their ſeed; will ſhew mercy to thouſands of their poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, to the childrens children of thoſe that keepe covenant, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, 18. that the promiſe is to the faithfull and their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that their children are holy, and ſuch places before cited, which will not ſuffer any one that beleeves Gods word to hold that the children of the faithfull dying in their minoritie, muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidably be damned all of them.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, I adde for anſwer to this Scripture, that infants of Chriſtian parents, as they are within the covenant, and are holy, ſo they may be ſaid to have a virtuall faith, or that which is analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall thereto, that giveth them right to baptiſme, as much as the converted heathens profeſſion; for being in covenant with God, and being holy, cannot be conceived to be without anſwerable faith, or ſomewhat equivalent.</p>
                  <p>At laſt you having triumphantly concluded your diſpute, come to ſhew your diſciples what they may ſee by what you have taught them. I will examine a few of your words.</p>
                  <q>Say you, By this we may partly ſee the groſſe miſtake of all ſuch great clarks of our times, which confound thoſe two Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants of Law and Goſpell, and make them both as one in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and different only in circumſtance, as in adminiſtration only or degrees, the one more darke, the other more light, whereas indeed they are no leſſe different then old and new, works and faith, the adminiſtration of condemnation, and the adminiſtration of righteouſneſſe, or then the letter killing, and the ſpirit giving life, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6.7.8.9. or then a ſtate of bondage, and a ſtate of ſonnes, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.21.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes, we may ſee what you inferre, as we may ſee falſe ſhapes by falſe glaſſes, or one falſhood by another. Secondly, may not ignorant phantaſticks poſſiblely fall into groſſe errours aſſoone as great clarks? Thirdly, as for the differences that you put be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Covenant of the Law, and of the Goſpell (as you call them) Firſt, we grant that the Covenant which God made with the Iewiſh, and that which he made with the Chriſtian
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:111961:45"/> Church, differ as old and new. But this is too narrow a difference to make them diverſe in ſubſtance: as he that was of old a child is a new become a man, yet differs not in ſubſtance from what he was, but is the ſame perſon. God gave that old commandement to the Iewes: Thou ſhalt love thy neighbour as thy ſelfe, <hi>Lev.</hi> 19.18. Chriſt ſaith to his Diſciples, A new commandment I give un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, that you love one another, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13.34. Muſt theſe comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements needs differ in ſubſtance? or muſt they be accuſed of groſſe miſtake that hold that theſe commandements agree in ſubſtance as being the ſame? The Apoſtle <hi>Iohn,</hi> 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.7. ſaith he writes no new commandement, but the old, yet <hi>verſ.</hi> 8. he ſaith he writes a new commandement. Will you ſay, That great clark <hi>Iohn</hi> was groſſely miſtaken in ſaying that he wrote no new com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, but an old: and yet preſently ſaying he wrote an old commandement? Becauſe in your conceit old and new ſo farre differ, that the ſame thing cannot be ſaid to be old and new, though in different reſpects, and in regard of ſome circumſtances.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, In your ſecond and third difference you (how great a Clark ſoever) are groſſely miſtaken in calling the old Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant made with the Iewes a Covenant of works, and a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of nature. Where finde you the Scripture calling it ſo? Will you perſwade men that <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob, Moſes, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> and the faithfull before Chriſt, where without faith and grace? That either they were ſaved by works and nature (for you will allow them to be under no covenant, but works &amp; nature you, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude them from faith and grace) or elſe to have periſhed remedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly? The one whereof muſt needs follow upon your tenet. But of this we have heard before, &amp; this your opinion is ſo abſurd and unchriſtian, that it deſerves rather to be abhorred then confuted.</p>
                  <q>Thirdly, whereas you call the old Covenant the adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of condemnation, and a killing letter, wherein you would have it contrary to the Goſpell as being the adminiſtration of righteouſneſſe, and ſpirit giving life, and bring that Scripture, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6.7.8 9.</q>
                  <p>I Anſwer: Firſt, there is no ſuch thing proved by that Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that the old covenant was the adminiſtration of condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and a killing letter. Secondly, neither can any ſuch thing be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; unleſſe we ſhall ſay that all which were under the old Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant were condemned, and killed, deſtitute of righteouſneſſe and life, and that God made a Covenant with his people to kill
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:111961:46"/> and condemne them (which will neceſſarily follow upon that te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net) which were blaſphemy.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the Apoſtle indeed calleth the law, which was an addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the covenant of promiſe, a killing letter, &amp; the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of condemnation, not as it was given and intended by God primarily, who gave it primarily and properly, to humble that ſtubborne people, drive them to the promiſe, and exerciſe them in obedience, and to be taken along with, (not apart from) the promiſe, and to traine them up for, draw them to, and direct them how to walke in, Chriſt, which is the end of the Law, not to drive them from Chriſt. But as it was in it ſelfe conſidered without the promiſe and without Chriſt, ſo it was a killing letter, and the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrie of condemnation; and as it was miſunderſtood and abuſed by falſe-teachers, hypocrites and Iuſticiaries: who before the comming of Chriſt forſaking the promiſe, and ſince his comming, forſaking the Goſpell; (both which held forth Chriſt, in whom a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone righteouſneſſe is to be ſought) or at leaſt mingling the Law and Goſpell together in point of juſtification, ſought righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe by the works of the Law either alone, or with the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell; to them it became a killing letter. And the addition of the Law to the promiſe, was a teſtimony, and an occaſion of greater condemnation to ſuch as they who abuſed it, ſought righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in it,<note place="margin">Rom. 7.12.14. Gal. 3.21 24.</note> and made their boaſt of it, but were not humbled, nor driven to Chriſt thereby, though in it ſelfe the Law was ſpirituall, holy, and good, not contrary but ſubordinate to the promiſe. As the Goſpell is an occaſion of greater condemnation even to thoſe that are externally under the Covenant of the Goſpell, who abuſe it 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.16. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.29. <hi>Iud.</hi> 1.4. Yet will it not hence follow that the Covenant of the Goſpell or new Covenant is the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of condemnation, though it turne to the greater condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of ſome for their abuſe of it.</p>
                  <q>Fourthly, As for your laſt difference; that a ſtate of bondage, this a ſtate of ſonnes.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Tis true, the Law given on mount <hi>Sinai</hi> (for of that the Apoſtle ſpeakes) as it was taken without the promiſe, and that Covenant which God made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and as men ſought juſtification by it, whether without the promiſe before Chriſt, or without the Goſpell ſince Chriſt, or whether they ſought juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by the Law together with the promiſe or the Goſpell, which was not Gods end in giving the Law to his people, but
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:111961:46"/> mans abuſe of it: ſo it brought men into a ſtate of bondage, and ſo the obſtinate Iews, that thus abuſe the Law, are caſt out as <hi>Iſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mael,</hi> and <hi>Hagar.</hi> And as the faithfull were under the diſcipline and padagogie of the Law, they were in a ſervile condition, in compariſon of that great freedome (from thoſe intolerable bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens of ceremonies, and great diſcomfort and feare accompany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame) which the faithfull have under the Goſpel. But notwithſtanding their bondage, they were ſonnes and heires and lords of all, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.1. and ſo they were under a Covenant of grace, though legally adminiſtred.</p>
                  <q>As for your following diſcourſe, wherein you talke your pleaſure againſt Magiſtrates and Miniſters, and cry out of the Baptiſme of Infants, as the greateſt deluſion, and a thing of as dangerous conſequence, as ever the man of ſinne brought into the world, and that the greateſt maintainers thereof are the greateſt deluders; and that it is time for you to awake out of your drunken ſlumber, and ſeek by whom and by what meanes you are ſo miſerablely intoſticated (as you call it, whether by an errour of the Printer, or becauſe you are ſo intoxicated with your drunken ſlumber, that you cannot ſpeake Engliſh,) with much other like raving talke; wherein you abuſe the Scriptures, and ſhew what manner of ſpirit you are of.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I account this wild talke, being the evaporations of a giddy braine, intoxicated with a drunken ſlumber whereof you complaine, worthy no other anſwer but this. Of every idle word you muſt give an account at the day of judgment, <hi>Matt.</hi> 12.36. much more of ſpeaking evill of thoſe things you know not, raill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon dignities, and authorities, deſpiſing dominions, 2, <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9.10.11.12. <hi>Iud.</hi> 4. &amp; 8 9. &amp;c. and of calling evill good, and good e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, putting darkneſſe for light, and light for darkneſſe, <hi>Eſ.</hi> 5.20. Which places of Scripture I would intreate you, when you ſhall awake out of your drunken ſlumber to conſider, and ſeriouſly ponder.</p>
                  <p>So much for the fourth argument, and clearing it from excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: Now I come to the fifth, which is of affinity with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer (and confounded with it by <hi>A. R.</hi> and therefore his anſwers to it, mingled with his anſwers to the former) but not the ſame, and therefore we will conſider it apart, and ſet downe his anſwers of any weight, and replie to them (God willing,) and this is taken from circumciſion.</p>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:111961:47"/>
                  <p n="5">5. Argument, If Infants of beleeving parents (or parents in Covenant) under the old Covenant, might and ought to be conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated unto God, and initiated into Covenant by circumciſion: then Infants of beleeving parents under the new Covenant, ought to be conſecrated to God, and ſolemnly entred into Covenant by Baptiſme.</p>
                  <p>But Infants of beleeving parents, under the old Covenant, might and ought to be conſecrated to God, and initiated into Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant by circumciſion, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.10.11. <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.48.</p>
                  <p>Therefore Infants of beleeving parents under the new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, ought to be conſecrated unto God, and ſolemnly entred into Covenant by Baptiſme.</p>
                  <p>For the clearing and confirming of the ſequele of the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition (for of the aſſumption, there is no queſtion) I will lay downe two or three conſiderations.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that the old and new covenant were one and the ſame for ſubſtance; <hi>Abraham, Moſes, David,</hi> and all the faithfull before Chriſt were under the ſame Covenant, that all the faithfull ſince Chriſt are under. For ſince <hi>Adams</hi> fall, there hath been but one way of ſalvation, common to all that have been ſaved; which way is revealed, and exhibited only in the Covenant of grace, as hath been partly ſhewed before, ſee <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.8. &amp; 14.6. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. through the Chapter, and 13.8. Hath been demonſtrated by the godly learned: and muſt be needs acknowledged by all that will without prejudice conſider that,<note place="margin">Exod. 34.6.7.</note> firſt, God conſidered as a merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fu l Father, a gratious &amp; long-ſuffering God, abundant in goodneſſe and truth,<note place="margin">Ezeh. 16.</note> is the Authour of the old Covenant, as well as the new: ſecondly,<note place="margin">Ioſh. 24. Exod. 33.19.</note> That man conſidered as a miſerable ſinner, yet weary of ſinne, deſiring mercy, profeſſing and promiſing, repentance, faith, and obedience,<note place="margin">Eph. 1.12.</note> upon his being received into this Covenant, is the other Covenantier or confederate in the old aſwell as in the new. Thirdly,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 10.4.</note> that Chriſt is the Mediatour in both, being the Lambe ſlaine from the foundation of the world,<note place="margin">Gen. 3.15. Ioh. 8. Pſ. 110. Exod. 34.7.</note> the promiſed ſeed, who brake the ſerpents head, whoſe day <hi>Abraham</hi> ſeeing rejoyced. A prieſt for ever after the order of <hi>Melchiſedek.</hi> Fourthly, that the principall good things promiſed in both, were pardon of ſinnes,<note place="margin">Pſ. 32.1.2.</note> adoption, ſanctification, perſeverance, and eternall ſalvation. Fiftly,<note place="margin">Gen. 15.6.</note> that the condition required is repentance, faith and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in the old Covenant, aſwell as the new. Sixtly, that the end in both is the ſame,<note place="margin">Act. 15.10.11.</note> to wit, the glory of Gods rich mercie; in pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:111961:47"/> ſpirituall, temporall, and eternall bleſſings upon his people. And ſeventhly, that the ſumme of the Covenant is the ſame, <hi>viz,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 4. Exod. 19.5, 6. Deut. 4.29, 30. &amp; 10.16.19 &amp; 11.22.</note> I will be thy God, and thou ſhalt be my people. All which are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denyably the ſame in the old Covenant and new. So that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering they agree in Author, Object, Mediator, Good things promiſed, Duties required, End, Effects, in a word, in Matter, Forme, and Definition, there can be no eſſentiall difference. Only they differ in ſome Accidents. As there the Covenant was made in Chriſt to come: Here in Chriſt already come. There with a few people, and after <hi>Abrahams</hi> (or at leaſt <hi>Moſes</hi> his) time, only with the houſe of Iſrael, and thoſe that ſhould joyne therewith: Here with more, even with all nations. Then diſpenſed by darker pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies, and more obſcure ſacraments, ſacrifices, and ceremonies or types; now by cleare revelation, and plaine or open ordinances, without the vaile of ſhadowes, types, and darke ceremonies. Then grace was more dimly, ſcantly, and with mixture of legall ſlavery, ordinarily beſtowed; now more plainly, plentifully, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably and freely; all which are but circumſtantiall, or graduall differences.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, when the new Covenant ſucceeded the old, then Baptiſme ſucceeded in the place of circumciſion; as the Lords Supper in ſtead of the Paſſeover.<note place="margin">Exod. 12 48. Rom. 4.11. 1 Cor. 12.13. Act. 22.16. Col. 2.11, 12.</note> I ſay Baptiſme ſucceeded in the roome of circumciſion, and is to us of the ſame uſe that circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was to the Iewes, to wit, a ſigne of entrance into the Church, a ſeale of the righteouſneſſe of faith, which comprehends remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſinnes, Baptiſme of the ſpirit, and circumciſion of the heart; which are the things ſignified in Baptiſme. Inſomuch that the Apoſtle puts circumciſion without hands, in puting off the body of ſinnes &amp;c. and buriall with Chriſt in Baptiſme, &amp;c. for one and the ſame thing, implying that though we now want outward circumciſion with hands, yet we have inward circumciſion with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hands, ſignified and ſealed in Baptiſme to ſo many as have Chriſt. And ſo though the beleeving Iewes before Chriſt, want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the outward ſacrament of Baptiſme; yet they were inwardly partakers of Baptiſme without hands, in remiſſion of ſinnes and mortification (ſealed by circumciſion) aſwell as we. So then if by being buried with Chriſt in Baptiſme, we are partakers of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion without hands; It appeares that Baptiſme is of the ſame uſe to us, that circumciſion was to the Iewes, whereof one particular among the reſt, was to be a ſigne of entring into the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:111961:48"/> Church or Covenant, as may be ſeen in the generall uſe of both the Sacraments, and which our Saviour (it may ſeem) would in ſpeciall teach us by his example, in that at the eight day he was circumciſed, as a profeſſed Member of the Iewiſh Church; but after when he would ſet up the new Covenant or Chriſtian Church, he was initiated thereinto by Baptiſme. So that though in ſome things circumciſion and baptiſme differ: as, firſt, in the ourward ceremonies. Secondly, in regard of the ſexes to which applyed, (for circumciſion was applied only to males, the females being uncapale, and ſo being received into Covenant, in or with the males, whereas Baptiſme is applied to both ſexes, being both alike capable of it.) Thirdly, in the exact determinate time, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the one, <hi>viz,</hi> circumciſion, tied to the eight day; but left free and undetermined in the other, ſo that it be done as ſpeedily as conveniently may be, after the party is apprehended and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to be within the Covenant, and ſo to have right to the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament. And fourthly, in the adjuncts or effects. Circumciſion with ſpilling of blood, Baptiſme without blood, becauſe the true blood of the Covenant is ſhed, and therefore no more to be ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed by bloody ſacrifices or ſacraments as aforetime. Yet they agree in the maine end and uſe. Circumciſion and Baptiſme be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſignes of entrance into the Church, as the Paſſeover and the Supper, ſignes of continuance; and ſo conſequently circumciſion and Baptiſme to be applied to thoſe that were but newly in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, as to Infants of beleevers, and infidels newly converted; the other to be uſed by them that had attained to ſome growth. Thoſe to be applied but once to one perſon, as ſignifying our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall birth, which is but once; but theſe often to be uſed, as ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying ſpirituall nouriſhment and growth, which muſt be often and continuall untill we come to perfection, though we bee not bound to the diſtinct times, in uſing Baptiſme and the Lords Supper, that were appointed for circumciſion and the Paſſeover, <hi>viz.</hi> the eight day from the birth for the one, or the foureteenth day of the firſt moneth yearely for the other.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, conſider that Gods bounty and grace on the one ſide; or mans dutie, and obligation on the other ſide, is nothing dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed or ſtraitned in the time of the New Teſtament, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of what was under the Old: but rather much increaſed and inlarged, in reſpect of manifeſtation, more abundantly to Chriſtians then Iewes; as the whole courſe of the Scripture
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:111961:48"/> ſhews. So that if God was pleaſed graciouſly to accept into co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, parents together with their children then; and to become the God of the little infants, as well as of the parents; and to ſet the ſeale of the covenant upon the infants, for the confirmation of faith, and comfort of the parents for the time preſent, and of the children for the future, when they ſhould come to underſtanding: And if he were then pleaſed to binde parents to offer and dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate their children unto him by the ſeale of entrance into cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant: much more he vouchſafeth the former, and requireth the latter, now under the Goſpel.</p>
                  <q>To this you anſwer,<note place="margin">A. R.</note> God commanded <hi>Abraham</hi> to circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe all the males in his houſe; and every male childe at eight dayes old, as well he that was borne in the houſe, as he that was bought with mony of any ſtranger that was not of his ſeed. Now it was both right and equall that <hi>Abraham</hi> ſhould doe herein as God commanded him, and it had beene ſinfull in him to have done otherwiſe more or leſſe. And ſo likewiſe it is meet for us to doe as God hath commanded us to doe; and no otherwiſe. And afterwards (to omit repetitions of the ſame things, and ſome objections and anſwers which you make, that either concerne us not, or have beene ſufficiently anſwered al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready) you ſay: we muſt baptize infants, when we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to doe it, and not before; notwithſtanding their being capable of baptiſme with all its ſignifications.</q>
                  <p>
                     <label type="milestone">

                     </label> 
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> It was ſhewed before that the reſtraining of circumciſion to males, and tying of it to the eighth day, were accidentall, and peculiar to circumciſion: as being the ſeale and ſacrament of entrance into the old covenant, whereas ſome things are eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall and common to the ſeales of entrance in both covenants. And therefore though the argument hold not from one Sacrament to another in thoſe things that are accidentall and proper to the one: yet it holds from one to another, in thoſe things that are common and eſſentiall, as we juſtly maintaine againſt our adverſaries the Papiſts; that every Sacrament is a ſeale of the covenant of grace, or of the righteouſneſſe of faith: becauſe circumciſion was ſo, to which you ſeeme to aſſent, calling Baptiſme a pledge of remiſſion of ſinnes; though the name of pledge or ſeale be not expreſly given to other ſacraments in ſcripture. Now we learne, by the Iſraelites frequent uſing of the Paſſeover, that the Sacrament of the Lords Supper is oft (not once onely, as Baptiſme) to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:111961:49"/> by Chriſtians; (though otherwiſe we have no expreſſe clear command for the oft receiving of it) howbeit we be not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to one in the yeare onely, nor to the time of Paſſeover, nor to the uſe of unleavened bread, and ſuch things as were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to the Paſſeover: ſo though we doe not in baptiſme obſerve the ſame ceremonie, nor preciſe time, nor ſex that was peculiar to circumciſion; yet we juſtly gather, that baptiſme belongs to ſuch perſons for age, <hi>viz.</hi> Infants (though there were no expreſſe command in Scripture for it) and that upon the grounds afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Gods command to <hi>Abraham</hi> as he was the father of the faithfull, is ſufficient warrant for our actions, though we have no ſpeciall command for the ſame, ſet downe in the New Teſtament, much leſſe brought to us by any ſpeciall revelation as to <hi>Abraham;</hi> even when in regard of ſome ſpeciall acts, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny circumſtances we may not doe as <hi>Abraham</hi> did: yet by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of Gods commandement to <hi>Abraham,</hi> we are bound to doe that which is analogicall thereunto.<note place="margin">Gen. 17.1. Gen. 17.23. Gen. 22. Gen. 18.19.</note> For example, God comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Abraham</hi> to walke before him and be perfect. This binds us as well as <hi>Abraham,</hi> though <hi>Abrahams</hi> circumciſion of himſelfe and his family, his purpoſe and endevour to offer up his ſonne <hi>Iſaac;</hi> his commanding and teaching his children and houſhold not onely in morall duties, but alſo ceremoniall, in reſpect of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion and ſacrifices, were parts of his walking before God, and being upright: yet we may not imitate him in thoſe very particulars. But in thoſe duties required in the New Teſtament, which are analogicall and proportionable to theſe; as giving up our ſelves and ours unto God, in the uſe of thoſe Ordinances which he for the preſent hath appointed, in denying our ſelves in our deareſt comforts, and bringing up our children in feare and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of the Lord. And ſo whereas God promiſeth to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> to be his ſhield, and exceeding great reward, and his All-ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient God: we may apply theſe promiſes to our ſelves, though our condition be not the ſame in all things with <hi>Abrahams,</hi> though we be not in danger of having the nations to riſe up againſt us for reſcuing <hi>Lot,</hi> &amp;c. So God promiſeth to be God to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> and his ſeed, and requires that he ſhould lay hold on the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe by faith, not onely for himſelfe, but alſo for his children, and ſo give up his children unto God in circumciſion; which is a ground ſufficient for Chriſtian parents to lay hold on the promiſe of God for themſelves and their children, &amp; give them up to God
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:111961:49"/> God in baptiſme, notwithſtanding ſome circumſtances, wherein the promiſe and command made to <hi>Abraham</hi> differ from them, as they are applied unto us So God gave a command and a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe unto <hi>Ioſhua:</hi> I will be with thee,<note place="margin">Joſh. 1.5.6. to the 9.</note> I will not faile thee nor forſake thee. Be ſtrong and of a good courage, &amp;c. This promiſe and command we may, and ought to apply to our ſelves in any worke that God calls us unto, as if it had beene made unto us in particular, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.5. Though we be never made Captaines of hoſts; to goe againſt Canaanites, or take poſſeſſion of a promiſed land; or be types of Chriſt, the true and reall <hi>Ioſhua,</hi> or Ieſus, all which were peculiar to that Worthy: yet the command and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe concern us as well as him, as the Apoſtle in that place ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. Elſe if you will not grant, that we are bound to beleeve pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, and obey commands, made to <hi>Abraham</hi> or ſome other ſpeciall perſons; unleſſe we obſerve all circumſtances and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar actions, in obeying the command; and jumpe with their eſtate in every particular qualification, in receiving the promiſes: you will deny that we have any thing to doe with any command or promiſe of God, and ſo go about to overturne all the conſolation of the faithfull, and diſcharge them of all their dutie. But ſeeing none, I hope, is ſo fooliſh as to follow ſuch abſurdities, we may ſafely hold, (notwithſtanding what you object) that <hi>Abrahams</hi> promiſe for his children, and command to circumciſe them; is a good ground for Chriſtian parents, to lay hold on the covenant for their children, and to preſent them to God in baptiſme.</p>
                  <q>Thirdly, whereas you ſay, As <hi>Abraham</hi> did what God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him, ſo muſt we doe as he commandeth us; and again, we muſt baptize infants when we are commanded, and not before.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I hope your meaning is not, that we muſt have imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate revelation from God, as <hi>Abraham</hi> had; for if untill then we ſit ſtill, we ſhall never obey nor beleeve. Otherwiſe ſo many as are the children of <hi>Abraham</hi> acknowledge themſelves bound by Gods command to him, to give up himſelfe and his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren unto God, to doe the like; though they have no new reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation from God, neither are bound to obſerve all circumſtances that <hi>Abraham</hi> was.</p>
                  <q>You bring us in objecting: God gave to infants circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which was a ſigne or ſeale of the righteouſneſſe of faith, and regeneration, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.11. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11. and we know God
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:111961:50"/> gave no lying ſigne, nor ſealeth a covenant to any perſons that are not therein: Therefore infants are in the covenant, have faith, and regeneration, and ſo ought to be baptized now, as well as circumciſed then. To which you anſwer. It is true, God gives no lying ſign, nor ſealeth to any perſons that they are in covenant when they are not; and therefore ſeeing that <hi>Iſhmael</hi> was cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed after that God had declared, and made it knowne, that he was not in covenant, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.18, 19, 20, 21. it muſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that circumciſion was not by God ordained, nor by <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> underſtood, to be to the perſons circumciſed a ſeale of their being in covenant; and much leſſe of their being in the faith and regeneration. Wherefore, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.11. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.11. which this objection is grounded upon, of neceſſitie muſt be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, as it is applied by the Apoſtle, to wit, that circumciſion received both upon himſelfe and his ſeed, was to him and to them a ſigne and ſeale, that righteouſneſſe ſhould be by faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. <hi>verſ.</hi> 3.11, 12. to 24.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> God doth not declare there, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.18, 19. and cited by you, nor any where elſe that <hi>Iſhmael</hi> was not in covenant; for though the covenant was eſtabliſhed with <hi>Iſaac,</hi> ſo that he and his poſteritie ſhould continue in covenant untill the promiſed ſeed ſhould come of his poſteritie: yet <hi>Iſhmael</hi> was outwardly in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.10, 11, 12, 13, 14.23.25. untill he diſcovenanted himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, whether is it fit that we ſhould beleeve you, or God himſelfe ſpeaking, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. and <hi>Paul</hi> (interpreting that place, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.) who had the mind of Chriſt, and the Spirit of God? you ſay, that circumciſion was not ordained by God, nor under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by <hi>Abraham</hi> to be to the perſon circumciſed, a ſeale of their being in covenant, much leſſe of their being in the faith, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, (though we ſay not that it was ſo:) God ſaith, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.10, 11. This is my Covenant which ye ſhall keepe between me and you, and thy ſeed after thee: every manchilde among you ſhall be circumciſed, and you ſhall circumciſe the fore-skinne of your fleſh, and it ſhall be a token of the Covenant betwixt me and you. And <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Abraham</hi> received the ſigne of circumciſion, a ſeale of the righteouſneſſe of faith, &amp;c. Let men judge whether of theſe two parties teſtimonies is more worthy credit.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, It is not to be queſtioned but thoſe Scriptures, <hi>Gen.</hi>
                     <pb n="91" facs="tcp:111961:50"/> 17.7. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.11. muſt be underſtood as the Apoſtle applieth them. But ſo farre is the Apoſtles application there, from exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding or denying our interpretation of thoſe Scriptures, <hi>viz.</hi> that God ordained, and <hi>Abraham</hi> underſtood circumciſion to be a ſeal of their being in Covenant, and ſo a ſeale of faith and regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to thoſe that worthily uſed it; that the Apoſtles application preſuppoſeth this, and therefore gathers, becauſe circumciſion was a ſigne of the Covenant, and a ſeale of the righteouſneſſe of faith, that righteouſneſſe comes by faith, not by workes.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, If the ſame was not the uſe of circumciſion to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> and his poſteritie for the ſubſtance, to wit, to be a ſigne of their being in covenant, and ſeale of the righteouſneſſe of faith, in your opinion; why doe you not ſhew the difference of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> circumciſion and theirs? If you ſay, it was to <hi>Abraham</hi> a ſeale of his faith, righteouſneſſe, and regeneration, that he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, to them of that which they were to have: I anſwer, this is but a circumſtantiall difference, and gives what we deſire, and maintaine. If you ſay, that many who were circumciſed were never juſtified by faith, or regenerated; this was mans abuſe, and fault, who being received into ſuch a Covenant, wherein God promiſed to be his God, and was ready to performe his promiſe, yet would not performe the conditions required in the covenant. For if ſome that received circumciſion, were never internally in Covenant, nor indued with the righteouſneſſe of faith, that hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders not but that circumciſion was a ſigne of their being outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly received into that covenant wherein God was ready to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow faith and regeneration, if through their owne default they did not deprive themſelves thereof. Beſides, if there was not the ſame uſe of circumciſion to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his children circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed by Gods appointment: How doe you ſay, in your <hi>Preface to the Reader,</hi> That baptiſme is an undoubted pledge from God of the free pardon and remiſſion of ſinnes to the right ſubjects there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: ſith it may with as good reaſon be ſaid, though it were ſo in our Saviours time, yet it is not ſo now; as you ſeeme to beare men in hand: Though circumciſion was a ſeale of the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of faith, and a ſigne of the covenant between God and him to <hi>Abraham;</hi> yet it was not ſo to his poſteritie, though they were the right ſubjects thereof, whom God had appointed to be cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed. But if you rightly gather that Baptiſme is an undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted pledge of the pardon of ſinne to the right ſubjects thereof
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:111961:51"/> now becauſe it was ſo to thoſe which were firſt baptized; we may as well gather, that circumciſion was a ſigne of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and ſeale of the righteouſneſſe of faith, to thoſe infants which by Gods appointment received it, as it was to <hi>Abraham.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hitherto of thoſe Arguments of ours, whereunto this Diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant anſwers. As for the other Arguments and Objections which he brings and anſwers, I ſhall leave them to defend them that owne them. I will adde briefly one or two Arguments more.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">4. <hi>Arg.</hi>
                     </note>
                     <hi>Arg.</hi> 6. If the baptizing of Infants born of Chriſtian parents (or parents within the new covenant) be not according to the rule of Gods word, then there is no rule or warrant in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture for baptizing the poſteritie of beleevers, under the New covenant at all, and ſo conſequently the children of beleevers muſt not be baptized at all, neither young nor old; for we muſt do nothing without Scripture warrant.</p>
                  <p>But that the poſteritie of Chriſtian parents ought not to be baptized at all; is moſt abſurd and falſe, as I think will be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged of all that beare the names of Chriſtians. For how can it be ſuppoſed, that the faith and Chriſtianity of the parents, ſhould be ſo prejudiciall to the children, as to deprive them of the pledge of the remiſſion of ſinnes, though they repent and beleeve; when yet the poſteritie of Infidels may be baptized, upon their faith and repentance? Therefore the Antecedent muſt needs be falſe, (<hi>viz.</hi> that the baptizing of infants of Chriſtian parents is not according to the rule of the word) and conſequently the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory thereto true. <hi>viz.</hi> that the baptizing of infants borne of parents in covenant is according to the rule. The Aſſumption I conceive needs no proofe ſeeing Chriſt hath appointed, that the Sacraments of the New Teſtament ſhould be perpetuall to the end of the world, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19.20. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.26. to thoſe that ſhould be in Covenant.</p>
                  <p>For the confirmation then of the propoſition, and making cleare its conſequence: Conſider, firſt, there is no command, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample or other teſtimony in Scripture, can be given to ſhew that the children of teſtimony in Scripture, can be given to ſhew that the children of beleeving parents ſhould be kept from baptiſme, untill they could in their owne perſons actually repent, beleeve, and make confeſſion of their faith. But ſtill when parents were converted to the faith and baptized, their whole families were
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:111961:51"/> baptized with them. Neither is there any word concerning the poſteritie of Chriſtian parents, (who were borne of them, being in covenant) to have been baptized in riper yeares.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, thoſe commands and examples of baptizing them that repented, beleeved, and profeſſed the faith, are all of ſuch as had before been out of the New covenant, and were come of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents that had never been under the covenant of the Goſpel; and therefore with leſſe reaſon can be applied to the poſteritie of Chriſtian parents, when they come to yeares of diſcretion, then when they were infants. For thoſe examples and commands ſhew that ſo ſoone as one is in covenant with God in the time of the Goſpel, he hath right unto baptiſme. Neither can it without ſinne to God and injurie to the perſon be denied to him, but ought to be adminiſtred ſo ſoone as it may conveniently be had. And therefore as they that had beene out of covenant before, ſo ſoone as they had repented and beleeved, (at leaſt profeſſed ſo much, which was neceſſary to their being taken into covenant) ought to be baptized, as ſoone as might be conveniently,<note place="margin">Act. 8.36, 37, 38. Act. 10.47. Act. 22.16.</note> and might not without injurie be hindred by others, or ſinne in themſelves neglect it: So the children of Chriſtian parents being in covenant, as hath beene proved, and cannot be denied with any ſhew of truth, (that I ſay not, without blaſphemy) cannot without inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie be denied baptiſme ſo ſoone as it may expediently be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred to them.</p>
                  <p>This Argument for more evidence and cleareneſſe may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded thus.</p>
                  <p>The poſteritie of beleevers either muſt be baptized in their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancie, or when they are able to make a profeſſion of faith, and do it really, or they muſt not be baptized at all.</p>
                  <p>But to hold that they ſhould not be baptized at all; but that all the children of beleevers ſhould be debarred baptiſme though they prove never ſo godly, is abſurd and wicked; that they ſhould be baptized onely when they come to yeares of diſcretion, and make profeſſion of faith and repentance, there is no warrant in Scripture, neither by command, practiſe, or otherwiſe, as hath been ſhewed.</p>
                  <p>Therefore they are to be baptized in infancie.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arg.</hi> 7. If Chriſtian women that are under the new covenant, have right to the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, and may and ought to be admitted thereunto (neither can without great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurie be detained therefrom) notwithſtanding their ſexe; though
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:111961:52"/> there be no cleare, expreſſe, direct and immediate command or example in the Scripture for the ſame: then may and ought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants of Chriſtian parents being in covenant, to be admitted to the Sacrament of Baptiſme; neither can without great injurie be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barred there from, notwithſtanding their age; though there were not any clear, expreſſe, direct &amp; immediat command for the ſame.</p>
                  <p>But Chriſtian women have right to the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, and may and ought to be admitted thereunto; neither can without great injurie be detained therefrom, notwithſtanding their ſexe; though there be no cleare, expreſſe, direct and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate command in Scripture, for womens being received to the Sacrament of the Lords Supper.</p>
                  <p>Therefore may and ought infants of Chriſtian parents being in covenant, to be admitted to the ſacrament of baptiſme; neither can without great injurie be debarred therefrom, notwithſtanding their age: though there were not any clear, expreſſe, direct and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate command or example in the ſcripture for the ſame.</p>
                  <p>For confirmation of the ſequele in the major or firſt propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition note: Firſt, there is as much cauſe to queſtion womens title to the Lords Supper, in regard of their female ſex, as there is cauſe of queſtioning childrens baptiſme, becauſe of their infant age; eſpecially, conſidering the female was deprived of one Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament in the old covenant; and there is no more (if ſo much) ſpoken in Scripture for womens being admitted to that, then for infants being admitted to this. Secondly, whatſoever can be ſaid or gathered by good conſequence from Scripture for Chriſtian women receiving the Lords Supper: the ſame, as much, or more, may as truly, and by as cleare conſequence be ſaid for the bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing of infants of Chriſtian parents. Are Chriſtian women of ſome ſtanding, and continuance in the covenant of grace, and ſo have title to the ſeale and Sacrament that ſignifies growth in grace, and continuance in Chriſt? No leſſe are infants of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian parents entred into the covenant of grace, by vertue of the covenant made with their parents, as hath been proved (and will not be denied I thinke by any that cares and knows what he ſaith) and ſo have title to the ſeal of admiſſion, or entrance into covenant. Have they (at leaſt in judgement of charitie) right to the thing ſignified in the Lords Supper, <hi>viz.</hi> Chriſt his body and bloud, with all the benefits of his death and paſſion? No leſſe have theſe (in the like judgement of charitie) right to the thing ſignified in baptiſme, <hi>viz.</hi> the Bloud and Spirit of
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:111961:52"/> Chriſt, pardon of ſinne and regeneration. Were they being the inferiour ſexe comprehended under the ſuperiour ſexe of men in the command? Why might not theſe as well being inferiours in age, and wholly at their parents diſpoſe, be comprehended under the command of baptizing the parents? Were they never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden nor excepted, or exempted from the Lords Supper, though not expreſſely commanded to receive it? The ſame may be ſaid concerning childrens baptizing. Have women need of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt to ſtrengthen faith, and quicken them to obedience as well as men? ſo have infants need of baptiſme to confirme faith in Gods gracious covenant, and incite to obedience, their parents for the preſent, and themſelves for the future. Is it more then probable that (although at the firſt inſtitution of the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, there were no women, becauſe Chriſt had none preſent, but onely his owne family, and peculiar flock of his Diſciples who were all men; yet) <hi>Act.</hi> 2.42. (if breaking bread unqueſtionably ſignifie the uſe of the Sacrament there) and <hi>Act.</hi> 20.7. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. when mention is made of the Lords Supper, there were wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, though it is not expreſſed? No leſſe probably may it be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, that in thoſe families that were baptized, there were ſome children. In a word, were women admitted to eate of the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices and ſacrament of Paſſeover in the time of the old covenant among the Iewes? It is known that infants were received to the Sacrment of circumciſion in the old Covenant likewiſe. So that I ſee no reaſon why the one ſhould be queſtionable when the other is not called into queſtion.</p>
                  <p>For the Aſſumption or minor propoſition, it hath two things in it to be confirmed: firſt, that there is no direct, expreſſe, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate command, or example in the Scripture, for women re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, more then for chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens being baptized. This is eaſily proved by turning over to all thoſe places of Scripture that ſpeak of the Lords Supper, which are not many, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.26, 27, 28. <hi>Mar.</hi> 14.22, &amp;c. <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.19, &amp;c. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.22. &amp; 20.7. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. &amp; 11. neither do I remember any other places that ſpeake expreſly of this Sacrament, in all which places is no mention of women.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond part of the aſſumption is, that notwithſtanding this is not expreſſed in ſo many words in Scripture, that beleeving wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſhold receive the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the Lords Supper; yet that they may &amp; ought to be admitted, neither can without injury be debar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red:
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:111961:53"/> which is ſo univerſally (for ought I know) acknowledged, that I never heard it queſtioned: And he that ſhould queſtion it, might ſeeme worthy of deteſtation or contempt, rather then anſwer, or diſputation. It may be confirmed by ſuch grounds, as were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated in my confirmation of the propoſition, And my reaſon why I ſay this is an unqueſtionable truth, Beleeving women have right to the Lords Supper aſwell as men, &amp; that by Scripture war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, is the received maxime in Divinity, that what is contained in Scripture in expreſſe words, or may be gathered from the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by juſt conſequence, hath ſufficient warrant from Gods word, and is a matter of faith. Or, as it is expreſſed by ſome, thus. A ſcripture commandeth, promiſeth or threatneth, whatſoever is contained in it, though not expreſſed; and that is contained in it, which may juſtly, and truly be gathered from it, though by never ſo many conſequences or inferences. Now I hope none queſtions, but that it may by juſt and undenyable conſequences be proved, that beleeving women aſwell as men, ought to receive the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and ſo it hath been proved, that children ought to be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed; otherwiſe if we will not admit that we have ſufficient ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture warrant, not only for that which is expreſly ſet downe in ſcripture; but alſo for whatſoever by juſt conſequence is or may be deduced therefrom: we ſhall deprive our ſelves of all or moſt Scripture-promiſes or priviledges, and exempt our ſelves of all or moſt commands. Seeing what is ſet downe in the Scripture, is not ſpoken immediatly and expreſſely to us in particular, but only by juſt conſequence or inference is derivable and appliable unto us. And therefore let thoſe that either out of ignorance and ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or wilfulneſſe and prophaneneſſe, think that there is warrant or obligation for nothing to be done, as an act of faith and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but what is ſet downe or they are commanded expreſſely and clearely in the ſcripture, in ſo many words, take heed they doe not at once, deny to God all obedience, and to their ſoules all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in the promiſes. This laſt argument may be ſummed up briefly thus.</p>
                  <p>If it be not warrantable for children to be baptized, then it is not lawfull for women to receive the Lords Supper; for as much may be ſayd for that, as for this, and againſt this as that. But the conſequent is abſurd; therefore the antecedent is falſe. And this I would wiſh thoſe women to conſider, which by reaſon of the weakeneſſe of their judgment, are apteſt to be deceived, by thoſe
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:111961:53"/> that creep into houſes, and leade captive ſilly women laden with ſinnes, led away with diverſe luſts, ever learning, and never a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to come to the knowledg of the truth. For if they ſhould yeeld to this perſwaſion, their children muſt not be baptized in their infancie, becauſe the Scripture doth not expreſſely command it; On the ſame ground, they muſt yeeld that they themſelves have nothing to doe with the Supper; and ſo by degrees they may be cheated of all Gods Ordinances and their comforts, priviledges, and obedience, on the ſame grounds. As alſo I would wiſh that the foregoing argument may be conſidered by them, who have refuſed to have their children baptized in infancie, and ſhew what ground they have in Scripture for baptizing them when they come to yeares of diſcretion. I cannot ſee but they have as great cauſe to queſtion, whether ever their children may be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized as whether they may baptize them in infancy. Let them give an example or command in ſcripture, expreſſe or by juſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, of a beleeving Father which kept his child unbaptized, untill he actually beleeved, and then brought him to baptiſme. And then let them bethinke themſelves whether the iſſue will not be, either their poſterity muſt not be baptized at all, (though they beleeve and repent never ſo much) and ſo they caſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and their children out of Covenant; or they muſt be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed without warrant, or commande (for all thoſe examples and commands that are in ſcripture of faith required in thoſe that ſhould be baptized, ſpeake of them who themſelves and their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents till that time had not been under the new Covenant.) Or laſtly, if they will have thoſe commands and examples for their warrant and applyable to them; they and their children muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come infidels, and perſons out of Covenant, and deny that ever they were in Covenant before, or had received any ſpirituall and Evangelicall favour, that ſo now at laſt entering newly into the Covenant of grace by faith and repentance, whereunto they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe that they have been hitherto ſtrangers, they may receive the Sacrament or pledge of admiſſion into Covenant. Which how injurious it would be to Gods grace, and their own ſouls and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteritie, if ever they taſted of Gods mercy, or were but external<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Covenant, let all men judge.</p>
                  <p>It is uſuall in controverſies of this kinde, after Scripture proofes and reaſons deduced therefrom and grounded thereon, to produce the conſent and teſtimony of the Godly and learned, whether
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:111961:54"/> Ancient or Modern; eſpecially, the former, that were moſt neere the Primitive pureſt times; And I doubt not if a man had helps and leiſure for ſearching Antiquitie, it might be eaſily ſhewed, that the baptizing of Infants was long in uſe before Antichriſt got to his throne, (contrary to the opinion of this diſputant) yea in the Primitive times (unleſſe Authors be ſilent in this point, (becauſe no controveſie then roſe above this matter) or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted:) But as I have ſaid, neither having the books of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients, that ſpeak of this ſubject, nor time well to turne over thoſe volumes, if I had them, I muſt forbeare. Onely let the Reader a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain take notice of theſe two firſt-mentioned and Prime Authors whom <hi>A. R.</hi> cites for his purpoſe. For as touching <hi>Origens</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving teſtimony, that baptizing children was a ceremony or tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Church, (not to examine how truly theſe words are cited out of the Author, which I cannot for the reaſon aforemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, but to take the words on his truſt) This teſtimony ſhews that in his time, who lived but 200. yeares after Chriſt, it was a thing ordinarily practiſed, and (as I ſhewed before in vindicating my third Argument) an unqueſtioned practiſe, from which as an undeniable principle, that holy man ſeemes to prove that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants of a day old are not free from ſinne. And let none be offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that it is called a ceremony, though that name, as it is uſed for humane traditions beſide or contrary to Gods word, is odious, yet the word may in its proper ſignification be uſed for any rite, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther humane or divine, and both Baptiſme and the Lords Supper may fitly be called ceremonies now; as well as Paſſeover, Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, and other Divine Ordinances, inſtituted by God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Iews. Neither let any be troubled at the word Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for that is uſed not onely to note things taken up by men, but alſo for the Doctrine of God,<note place="margin">

And whereas it is ſaid, a ceremony or tradition of the Church, there is no neceſſitie that it ſhould be underſtood that the Church was the Authour thereof, but the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject (in which it was uſed, and by which it was delivered to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteritie) may well be meant, by that phraſe. So <hi>Auguſtine</hi> (who lived in the fourth Century after Chriſt) calles it a cuſtome (as he ſaith) of the Church. Which yet he might well doe, and yet it be a divine ordinance, for all Gods ordinances are or ſhould be in cuſtome in the Church. But if it were a cuſtome of the Church in <hi>Auguſtines</hi> time, (and a ceremony or tradition of the Church
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:111961:54"/> in <hi>Origens</hi>) ſure it is ſtrange that it ſhould be brought into uſe a thouſand yeares after Chriſt, as one of his Authours ſaith, and be a deviſe of Antichriſt, as he holds. For cuſtomes are things that have been of long uſe and ancient ſtanding. And whereas ſome Authours ſpeake of ſuch as were Catechized and inſtructed by the Church, before they were baptized, and muſt give a reaſon of their faith before they were admitted to Baptiſme, and that they uſed to Baptize ſuch at two times of the yeare onely. I beleeve it will be apparent to thoſe who looke into theſe Authours, that they ſpeake not of the children of beleeving parents: but that thoſe <hi>Catechumeni,</hi> who were firſt Catechized and then baptized, were Pagans (who lived in thoſe parts where the Church was) which were quite out of Covenant, and therefore, becauſe God did not ſo miraculouſly and ſuddenly bring ſuch to the faith, as in the times of the Apoſtles, ſome ſpace was required to inſtruct them in the principles of Religion, before they could be judged fit for Baptiſme. But as I ſaid, I may not meddle with the exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of his authorities, nor produce any humane authoritie for this; ſeeing it hath been ſufficiently confirmed by Arguments drawn from Scripture grounds; though it were an eaſie thing, I ſuppoſe, to beat this Adverſary with his own weapon. And it might be an uſefull worke if ſome Antiquary would take the pains to turne over the ancient Writers, and ſhew what they have left on record concerning this ſubject.</p>
                  <p>I will come to make ſome practicall uſe and improvement of this diſpute, and ſo end. Seeing all thoſe Arguments that have been brought againſt the baptizing of Infants, have been anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and our Arguments for it defended (through the help of God and in his feare, how ſufficiently let others judge) ſo that the weakneſſe of the Adverſaries Arguments hath beene detected, and the truth vindicated againſt cavils, and it hath been proved from Scripture grounds, that children of parents within Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant have right to Baptiſme; this diſcourſe may ſerve.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, To admoniſh ſuch as the Authour of this pamphlet an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered that are ſo pragmaticall in broaching their new conceits, that they would impartially, and without prejudice, weigh and examine their owne tenents and grounds by the Scripture, before they proceede with ſuch confidence, and heate, to commend them to, and urge them upon others, deride, rayle upon and condemne, as Antichriſtian and Deceivers, all that will not receive their
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:111961:55"/> doctrines as infallible. I would wiſh them to conſider whether this be the truth of God that they pleade for, and maintaine, with ſuch groſſe perverting, abuſe, and falſifying of Scripture, as hath beene ſhewed throughout the booke; whether hath the cauſe of God neede to be upholden with manifeſt errors, and thoſe of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry dangerous conſequence, bordering on blaſphemie, ſuch as have beene diſcovered in this Authour; as calling the Covenant under which the faithfull were before Chriſt, a Covenant of workes, of Nature, and of condemnation: And caſting out all infants of the holieſt Chriſtian parents from the Covenant of Grace, and making them equall with the Children of Turkes, at leaſt whiles in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, and many errors of like ſort, and that againſt playne Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.

I know the beſt of Gods ſervants may erre in judgement, aſwell as faile in practiſe; But ſuch will bleſſe God for diſcovering their errour, and be thankfull to the inſtrument which he uſeth for that end, and to ſuch doubtleſſe God is ready to ſhew mercy in forgiving their errours. But as for them who for their credit ſake (as they thinke) when their errours are diſcovered, and oppoſed, ſhall be more bold in aſſerting them, fly out in rayling and bitterneſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe that would have given an helping hand to the redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of them to the truth, ſet their wits a worke, to invent new Arguments to maintaine falſhood againſt their own conſcience, and ſo to uphold one errour by another, (for no truth will patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize an errour) and conſequently run from one fond opinion into another; ſuch we are commanded after once or twice admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to reject,<note place="margin">Tit. 3.10, 11.</note> as knowing that they are ſubverted and ſinne being condemned of themſelves.</p>

Chriſtians ſhould try the Spirits, whether they be of God or no, not beleeving a tenent forthwith, becauſe men come with it to us,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 4.1.</note> under a pretence
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:111961:56"/> of love,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 11.13, 14, 15.</note> zeale, humility, &amp;c. Seeing Satan can change himſelfe into the likneſſe of an Angell of light, and his Miniſters are taught his art. God hath given us his word as a touchſtone, that we may try all things and hold faſt that w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is good. He hath appointed the Miniſters &amp; Miniſtery of his word to this end, that we may not be henceforth ſuch children,<note place="margin">Eph. 4.11, 12, 14.</note> as to be carryed about with every wind of vaine doctrine, by the ſleight of men and cunning craftineſſe whereby they lie in waite to deceive; and ſeldome doe we ſee any inſnared in theſe, and ſuch like errors, till they leave the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of the word; the ſpeciall meanes which God hath appointed to prevent them. It is true all Chriſtians ought to make tryall of their tenets, practiſe and worſhip, and not take them up meerely of cuſtome, becauſe they are generally received. But it is not ſafe for people to leave the Miniſtery of the word, and hearken to none but thoſe that wil humour them in their opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s &amp; ſay as they ſay. It is an argument that peoples opinions and practiſes are workes of darkneſſe, when they refuſe to come to the light to have them tryed. How miſerably may Satan and his inſtruments abuſe ſilly ſoules, if they can perſwade them to come into no company, but ſuch where they may be confirmed in their errours? I would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat ſuch to take heede leſt being drawn to renounce their Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme received in infancie (which is the drift of theſe men, by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading them that it is no Baptiſme) and keeping their Children unbaptized, they caſt themſelves and their poſterity out of Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, reject God the Father, Sonne and Holy Ghoſt, to whom they were conſecrated in Baptiſme by their parents, and ſo caſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way their Chriſtianity, their ſoules and ſalvation all at once; and not onely their owne, but their poſterities too. It cannot but bee very offenſive to God, whereas he hath offered himſelfe to be our God from our infancy, and taken us into his family, having made the promiſe and covenant to our parents and us their children, and ſealed the ſame Covenant to us, and really beſtowed on us (at leaſt ſome of us, and is ready to beſtow on us all if we be not wanting to our ſelves) what was in Baptiſme ſealed, namely remiſsion of ſinnes, regeneration, and the ſpirit of adoptions; if all this notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding we ſhall hearken to the enemy of Gods glorious grace and our ſoules greateſt comfort, perſwading us that neither wee were in Covenant with God, in our infancy, by vertue of the Covenant made with our parents; neither our children in any bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter condition then the children of Turkes and Pagans, untill the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:111961:56"/> time of actuall faith. If we ſet ſo little by Gods ancient mercies conveyed to our parents and us ſucceſſively, for many generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, according to his mercifull promiſe and covenant; let us take heede, leſt wee provoke him to caſt us off, and give us over to ſtrong deluſions, becauſe we have followed lying vanities, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken our owne mercies.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, ſeeing the children of the faithfull have right to the promiſes of thoſe bleſſings which are ſealed in Baptiſme, and not onely the beleeving Governours of families themſelves, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the whole families were baptized, the children of the faithfull are holy, within covenant and have right to Baptiſme, as well as infants in the Iewiſh Church had right to Circumciſion; upon which and the like grounds it hath beene proved that they ought to be baptized: This ſhould call upon Chriſtian parents that have or ſhall dedicate their children to God in Baptiſme, and all the poſterity of the faithfull that have beene conſecrated to God in their infancy by Baptiſme, both highly to eſteeme this priviledge and ancient faederall mercy of God; ſo that they doe not ſuffer themſelves to bee cheated of it by impoſtors: And ſo thankfully, holily and fruitfully to uſe it, that it may be a meanes to ſtrengthen their faith, and confirme them in the aſſurance of Gods love, and a ſpeciall ſpurre to holineſſe, and curbe to reſtraine from profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; and by all meanes take heede of ſo abuſing it, that it ſhould be an occaſion of Gods diſhonor (by cauſing this holy ordinance to be blaſphemed,) the offence &amp; ſtumbling of others, and their own greater condemnation. And this they ſhould the rather look unto:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, becauſe ſo many Chriſtians by profeſſion bring their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to baptiſme meerly of cuſtom; neither regarding the grounds on which, nor the end for which, nor the manner how, they ought to do this; neither conſidering the mercies which God offers to them, and their children, in this ſacred ordinance, nor yet the duties whereunto they and their children are herein obliged; as if Gods ordinances whereunto he cals us, the priviledges which he beſtowes on us, and the duties whereunto he bindes us were but matters of faſhion or ſport. And in like manner, many when they come to yeares of diſcretion, no more regard their baptiſme then a trifle, hardly ſo much as inquiring, why they were baptized.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, becauſe as the Apoſtle ſaid of circumciſion,<note place="margin">Rom. 2.25.</note> that it became no circumciſion, if men kept not the Law: ſo may I ſay, Baptiſme becomes no baptiſme to thoſe which walke not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:111961:57"/> to the Goſpel. Let us not thinke that the meere worke done makes us ſufficient Chriſtians. If men perſwade themſelves they may live ignorantly, profanely, and carnally; and yet hope to be ſaved, becauſe they have been baptized; let them read 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. <hi>verſ.</hi> 1. to the 12. for confutation of their errour, and diſcovery of the dangerouſneſſe and damnableneſſe of that opinion.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, as the name of God was blaſphemed by the Gentiles, through the vicious lives of the Iews,<note place="margin">Rom. 2.24.</note> who were by circumciſion conſecrated to God, and made his people by profeſſion: ſo is God, and Chriſt blaſphemed, and this holy Ordinance of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſme ſpoken evill of, by occaſion of the wickedneſſe of many that have beene baptized. For not to ſpeake of the blaſphemy of Turkes, Pagans, and Papiſts, caſt upon the Chriſtian Religion, for the profaneneſſe of Proteſtants; doe not we heare that ſome hence make bold to ſpeak evill of the Baptiſme of Children, as if it were the cauſe of all profaneneſſe and impietie that is in the Church? which though it be a moſt falſe calumnie, (and I know not how it can be excuſed from blaſphemy;) For are not many of thoſe that were baptized in infancie, pious, wiſe, and garcious Chrſtians? How can baptiſme then in infancie be the cauſe of profaneneſſe; ſeeing where the cauſe is, it produceth the effect? Were not there among the Iewes as many profane, ignorant, and diſordered perſons, as among us? ſhall men ſay, that circumciſing their children in infancie was the cauſe of it? that were plaine blaſphemie. Was there not notorious profaneneſſe in the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church, as among the Corinthians, &amp;c. Was baptiſme, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of infants, (which yet I thinke they will not ſay) or of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſours of faith and repentance, the cauſe of it? This imputation a Chriſtian eare will abhorre. Is not the word of God a ſavour of death and occaſion of hardning to ſome? the Sacrament of the Lords Supper an occaſion to ſome of temporall and ſpirituall judgements? Yet what Chriſtian dare ſay, that theſe are the cauſes of ſinnes in the Church? Yet I ſay, though this be a falſe and wicked imputation, that the baptizing of infants, is the cauſe of evils in the Church: let them looke to it that give occaſion of ſuch blaſphemy.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, all Chriſtians ſhould be ſtirred up the rather to make a good improvement of this priviledge of Chriſtian parents, in having God not onely for their God, but alſo for the God of their children; and ſo of the baptizing of their children, becauſe we ſee
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:111961:57"/> Satan ſo buſie to rob them of this moſt comfortable doctrine, and precious priviledge, concerning childrens being in covenant, by vertue of the covenant made with their parents; and ſo to drive Chriſtians to renounce their baptiſme received in infancy, and diſſwade them from tendering their children to God in baptiſme, and ſo to overthrow a maine ground of our comfort in Gods an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient love to us, and a ſpeciall motive to obedience.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, in a word; If we doe not prize, and profit by this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient love of God to us, which he hath ſhewed us from our birth, in taking us into externall covenant, wherein he is ready to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow the internall bleſſings: If we doe not take God for our God, repent of ſinne, and beleeve in Chriſt, according to the obligation of the covenant of grace, that was ſealed to us in baptiſme: If the baptized doe not give up themſelves to God actually in their own perſons when they come to yeers of diſcretion: And if parents be not carefull to bring up their children, whom they have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to God in baptiſme; we muſt know that all theſe mercies of God offered unto us; all the profeſſions of faith and obedience we have made, will riſe up in judgement againſt us and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe our condemnation, above the condemnation of thoſe that never were in outward covenant. Other men are not ſo faſt tied unto God as we that are baptized, who are now, no more our owne, but Gods tied unto him by covenant, which if we breake, it will be to our greateſt perill.</p>
                  <p>If it be demanded wherein this dutie of highly prizing, and holily improving this priviledge of baptiſme in infancie conſiſts? I anſwer.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, we ſhould labour to be well inſtructed and ſettled in the grounds of this action, <hi>viz.</hi> baptizing infants, which are Gods gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious covenant and promiſe, &amp;c. as hath been ſhewed before; that we may give a reaſon of our being baptized in infancie. That ſeeing our priviledge beſtowed by God, we may not ſuffer our ſelves to be ſophiſticated out of it by any; ſo as to be driven from our hold in the covenant of mercy, which God hath made to us and ours. To this end we ſhould ſolidly ſtudy the doctrine of Grace and of Baptiſme, and thoſe Arguments that have beene be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore handled. The reaſon why we ſo eaſily be driven by tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from faith, and obedience, duties, and priviledges; is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we doe not well meditate on, and throughly digeſt the grounds thereof. But when we are well and throughly perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:111961:58"/> on Scripture grounds, that this is a dutie enjoyned, and a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge beſtowed by God, we ſhall ſee there is cauſe to contend for the faith delivered to the Saints, <hi>Iud.</hi> 3.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, let parents looke that they offer up their children to God in baptiſme, with faith, prayer, and unfeigned purpoſe of heart to conſecrate them wholly unto God. And that they may make it appeare that they doe ſo indeed, let them look that they give up themſelves unto God in holy obedience, repentance and faith, praying earneſtly for their children; and when they be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of inſtruction, let them give them good example, bring them up in the feare and inſtruction of the Lord, putting them in minde of the covenant whereinto God hath taken them, and uſe all holy meanes to bring them to actuall faith, and holineſſe; and let them know that this is a neceſſary dutie required at their hand, whereunto (at leaſt implicitly) they obliged themſelves, when they tendred their children to baptiſme, wherein they may not be negligent without grievous ſinne of diſobedience to, and mocking of God, and moſt heinous injurie, and dangerous hazard to their owne and their childrens ſoules, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.7. <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.4. <hi>Epheſ</hi> 6.4.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, all thoſe that have beene baptized, remembring that now they are not their owne, but given up to God in the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace, and ſolemnly tendred to his Majeſty in this ſacred Ordinance of Baptiſme in the preſence of the Angels, and the congregation of the faithfull, (which act of their parents was not arbitrary, but neceſſary; and that whereunto they were abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bound by Covenant, <hi>viz.</hi> to take God for their God, and the God of their children; and give up themſelves and their children to God) All Chriſtians, I ſay, conſidering this that they were given up unto God in baptiſme, and that God graciouſly tooke them into covenant, and admitted them into his family, before they knew the right hand from the left, muſt (ſo ſoone as they are able to doe a morall act) give up themſelves unto God in their owne perſons, voluntarily, and gladly aſſenting unto, and ratifying that covenant which their parents entred into in their behalfe; ſeeing it is not now in their owne choyce to be of what Religion or converſation they will. They are bound to be Chriſtians and Saints, and that not onely by vertue of the creation, preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and redemption which God hath wrought for men: but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, by ſolemne promiſe, vow, and covenant. Inſomuch as thoſe
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:111961:58"/> who having beene baptized, live in wilfull ignorance, ſuperſtition, unbeliefe, profaneneſſe, covetouſneſſe, following the luſts of the fleſh, continue all that while in moſt treacherous breach of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and rebellion againſt God, whoſe ſervants they have bound themſelves to be, and yet ſerve his ſworne enemies; namely, the devill and their owne luſts. So that they have not onely forfeited their bonds, and deſerved for ever to be deprived of all thoſe glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and incomprehenſible benefits contained in the covenant of grace: but alſo have deſerved to be dealt with as perfidious Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, and traiterous revolters from their Lord and King. Which breach of Covenant, though the Lord will not impute to thoſe which ſeaſonably, heartily, and ſincerely repent, when they come to ſee what they have done (for they are in a covenant of grace which admitteth repentance:) yet when people come to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how they have ſinned againſt God in this kinde, muſt be the more humbled by this conſideration, that ſo many yeares after they were conſecrated unto God, they dealt traiterouſly and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belliouſly againſt him; and for the future be the more carefull to redeeme the time, and by ſo much more diligently and zealouſly to honour him for ever after, by how much careleſſe and looſe they have beene before. But they that doe not thus repent, and take care to keepe touch with God, ſhall know to their woe,<note place="margin">Gal. 6.7.</note> that God will not be mocked; and that it had been better many waies never to have beene baptized, or heard of the covenant of grace,<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 5.4, 5. 2 Pet. 2.21.</note> then to live wickedly and impenitently in a profeſſion of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianitie. Let Chriſtian parents whet theſe and ſuch like conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations on their children; yea let all Chriſtians from the youngeſt that are capable to the oldeſt, whet them on themſelves, and one on another, that they may be ſtirred up to give up themſelves wholly and really to God.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, whenſoever Chriſtians finde themſelves tempted to ſinne, or drawne from holineſſe, inclined to looſeneſſe, or backward to good duties: let them looke backward unto their baptiſme, and their conſecration unto God, and their abrenuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world, and the devil, tranſacted therein: and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that they were buried with Chriſt in baptiſme, and profeſſed a death unto ſinne, and a reſurrection to holineſſe, ſo that now it were a monſtrous and abſurd thing to live in ſinne, as for a dead man to riſe, or a living man to lie in the grave. Remember you are not your owne, but Chriſts, who is your Lord and Maſter, and
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:111961:59"/> ſo reſolve to continue ſtill doing his worke, and reſiſting his and your ſoules enemies. Thus the Apoſtle teacheth us from ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſme to fetch arguments of ſanctification, both for the mortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our corruption, and for the quickning of us to holineſſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.1, 2, 3, 4, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, In times of doubt, deſertion, temptation to diſtruſt, &amp;c. Chriſtians ſhould have recourſe to the conſideration of their baptiſme, and remember the ancient love of God to them in their infancy, in taking them into his family, and undertaking to be their God in baptiſme, wherein the whole Trinitie, Father, Sonne, and Holy Ghoſt, became ours, giving us under ſeale aſſurance of pardon, and peace, direction and ſupport, perſeverance and ſalvation. So that let our temptations, miſeries, and diſcomforts, be what they will; if we can but caſt our eye back on baptiſme, and the covenant of grace ſealed therein, we may gather ſtrong conſolation therefrom. And if we can in theſe and ſuch like parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars teſtifie our prizing and improvement of our baptiſme, we ſhall not eaſily be cheated of it, or drawne to queſtion whether we were ever truly baptized, ſeeing we daily find the comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able fruits and effects thereof: not ſhall we give occaſion to others to queſton whether our Infant baptiſme were true baptiſme, when we give a reall demonſtration to them that by vertue of the covenant of grace ſealed therein unto us, we walke as Chriſtians in all holy converſation.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, this may ſerve to ſtirre up the Miniſters of Chriſt, (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong whom I profeſſe my ſelfe the meaneſt and unworthieſt of any) that ſeeing there are ſo many pragmaticall deceivers abroad to ſeduce Gods people, not afraid to call in queſtion well-grounded truths, buzzing into the eares of the ſimple, ſuch things as tend to the overthrow of Chriſtian conſolation and chearfull obedience; ſpeaking perverſe things, by which they overturne whole houſes: This, I ſay, ſhould ſtirre us up if there be any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of our owne weightie duty, and dreadfull charge, any ſparke of compaſſion to mens ſoules, love to the truth, or zeale for Gods glory, to endeavour to prevent the inundation of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, rents, diſtractions, licentiouſneſſe and profaneneſſe that will unavoidably follow, upon the plucking up of theſe flood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates, to the overflowing of the Church, if ſome ſpeedy remedy be not applied, which belongs to the Miniſters of Chriſt princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally: ſhould it not grieve us to heare this holy function of the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:111961:59"/> Miniſtery, ſpoke of ſo diſdainfully (as it is in this Pamphlet an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered) as if our Miniſters were but a company of ignorant, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous, and ambitious men. And oh would, too great occaſion of this imputation were not given, by too many of our Miniſters! Woe to the world, (ſaith Chriſt) becauſe of offences;<note place="margin">Luk. 17.1, 2.</note> but woo to them by whom offences come. They that runne into theſe errours of Anabaptiſme by occaſion of the badneſſe of ſome Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, ſhall not thereby be excuſed, nor eſcape the woe, unleſſe they repent: But it had beene better for thoſe men, never to have meddled with the Miniſtery; yea to have beene throwne into the bottome of the ſea, with a milſtone about their necks, when they undertooke the charge of ſoules, who by their ignorance, lazineſſe, covetouſneſſe, pride, and ſuperſtition, have given occaſion unto ſome to raile on our Miniſtery, as Antichriſtian. And it is apparent that theſe errours are growne ſo rife and over-ſpreading through the ſilencing of good Miniſters and ſetting up and maintaining of ſuch as have beene careleſſe and ſcandalous. Therefore it greatly concerns all good Miniſters to ſeek a remedie to this evill,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 4.15. 2 Tim. 2.15. 2 Tim. 4.2.</note> by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving attendance to reading, exhortation, and doctrine. To ſtudy to ſhew themſelves approved workmen of God, that need not to be aſhamed, rightly dividing the word of truth; yea to preach the word in ſeaſon, and out of ſeaſon; rebuking and reproving, and exhorting with all long-ſuffering and doctrine, ſeeing the time is come when people will not endure ſound doctrine, but after their owne luſts, heape to themſelves Teachers having itching eares. If ever they had need, (tis now) to hold faſt the faithfull word, that they may be able by ſound doctrine, both to exhort,<note place="margin">Tit. 1.9, 10, 11.</note> and convince the gain-ſayers. Becauſe there are many unruly vaine-talkers, and deceivers, whoſe mouthes muſt be ſtopped, who ſubvert whole houſes, teaching things which they ought not. There is great need that Miniſters ſhould take heed to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,<note place="margin">Act. 20.28, 29, 30.</note> &amp; to the flock over which the holy Ghoſt hath made them Overſeers, to feed the Church of God which he hath purchaſed with his owne bloud; ſeeing grievous wolves are entred among us, not ſparing the flock; and from among our ſelves are men riſen which ſpeak perverſe things to draw diſciples after them. Theſe exhortations of the holy Ghoſt, and many more in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture to call us to our dutie, were never more ſeaſonable and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary. In obedience to which charges of God, let us therefore by painfull ſtudie, conſtant preaching, fervent prayer, and holy
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:111961:60"/> converſation, fit our ſelves for, employ our ſelves in, and procure authoritie to, the work of the Miniſtery, that we may be free from the bloud of all men, and that the people may be no more as children carried about with every winde of doctrine; nor for want of plenty of pure ſtreames, be forced to drink up the puddle waters of errours and deluſions.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, The conſideration of the pragmaticalneſſe of many in theſe dayes, to impoyſon the mindes, and trouble the hearts of Gods people, with ſtrange doctrines and dangerous errours; who doe not onely creepe into houſes to pervert the ſimple, but alſo are ſo bold as to divulge their opinions to the danger of many ſouls, as it appeareth by this Pamphlet anſwered, and the effects it hath wrought: The conſideration, I ſay, of the boldneſſe of ſuch perſons, and of the diſtractions and unſettledneſſe of the hearts of Gods people by occaſion thereof, ſhould ſtirre us up every one in his place, to doe what we can for applying a remedy to this miſerable diſtraction and ſpreading ſore. Let us receive the truth in the love thereof,<note place="margin">2 Theſſ. 2.10, 11. 1 Joh. 4.1.</note> leſt God be provoked to give us o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to ſtrong deluſions to beleeve lyes. Let us not be ſo fond as to beleeve every ſpirit, but try the ſpirits whether they be of God. Let us labour for ſoundneſſe of judgement, that we may diſcern between things that differ. But eſpecially, that we may procure a generall remedy not onely for our ſelves, but for our whole kingdome alſo. Let us by our repentance, and prayers, and all pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous endeavours, religious and civill, help our Religious, Honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, (and with all praiſe and thankfulneſſe to God ever to be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned) Parliament, into whoſe gracious hearts the Lord hath put a ſincere deſire, and ſtirred up to expreſſe an holy reſolution of endeavouring to finde out a remedy to this evill, that their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly endeavours may be bleſſed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, earneſtly craving of God, That as he hath been plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſo farre to honour the Honourable Aſſemblies endeavours, and his poore peoples prayers, as to call together an Aſſembly of Gods faithfull Miniſters, being men of approved pietie, ſinceritie and abilitie: ſo he would vouchſafe to ſtirre them up, direct and inable them, in the feare of God, without prejudice, by the Rule of the Scripture, to examine all ſorts of tenents that are contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted in the Church, giving libertie to every one that hath any thing to ſay for the truth (though but in pretence) to ſpeak their minde freely; that ſo Gods truth being cleared, and eſtabliſhed,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:111961:60"/> and errour unmasked and ſuppreſſed, Gods peoples hearts may be quieted. That this means is likely by the bleſſing of God to prove effectuall, if our ſinnes doe not hinder and deprive us of it and its expected bleſſing, may appeare by Chriſts promiſes <hi>Matt.</hi> 18.18, 19, 20. and the Apoſtles practiſe together with the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.1, 2, 3. to 32.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, Let us penitently, humbly and heartily crave of God, his bleſſing on his ſervants endeavours, for the ſettling of an able, painfull, and godly Miniſtery in this Land, and rooting out of the ignorant, idle, and ſcandalous Miniſtery, (ſeeing the abounding of this, and the want of that, hath been a principall cauſe of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, errour, Popery, Separation, and Anabaptiſme in the Land.) That every Congregation being furniſhed through Gods mercy (if we may be accounted worthy ſuch an happineſſe) with a faithfull Miniſtery, and Gods pure Ordinances, might be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully inſtructed in the truth of God: So that all Superſtition and Reliques of Popery on the one ſide being rooted out, and all phantaſticall opinions on the other ſide, confuted and exploded, Gods people may be guided in the even and cleare way to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; ſo that they may neither turne to the right hand nor to the left.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, We ought by our prayers, Repentance and all holy endeavours to promote and help forward that Religious deſigne of ſettling Church Government,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 1.4. Rev. 2.2.</note> and the Diſcipline of Ieſus Chriſt amongſt us. That an Authoritative charge may be laid on them that bring in ſtrange doctrine, that they proceed not to diſturbe the Church. And thoſe which ſay they are Apoſtles but are not, may be found lyers. That by it all truth, pietie, and ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, may be eſtabliſhed, approved, and maintained, with all means furthering the ſame. And that all things that tend to the maintaining of ſuperſtition, profaneneſſe, and ignorance, and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioning of diviſions, jarres, and ſeparations, may be removed. That theſe things have been, and ſtill are intended and laboured for, by that Honourable and Gracious Councell, and that Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and Learned Aſſembly, we have had large teſtimonies. It remaines, that we finde out and remove (as much as lyes in us) what hinders ſuch a mercy, moſt humbly and earneſtly intreating our gracious God, on whoſe bleſſings depends the ſucceſſe of all holy endeavours, and in whoſe hands are the hearts of all men: That he will ſtill proſper the labours of his ſervants, and ſtirre up
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:111961:61"/> the hearts of thoſe whoſe concurrence in this moſt Chriſtian de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne is of great concernment, to joyne with them, and further them therein: and remove out of the way whatſoever are the impediments thereof.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.10.</note> That ſo occaſions of diviſions being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, we may be perfectly joyned together in the ſame minde, and in the ſame judgement,<note place="margin">Eph. 4.3. and 12, 13, 14, 15.</note> in the truth. Endeavouring to keepe the unitie of the ſpirit in the bond of peace. That ſo the body of Chriſt may be edified; till we come in the unitie of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Sonne of God, unto a perfect man, unto the meaſure of the ſtature of the fulneſſe of Chriſt. That we henceforth be no more children toſſed to and fro, and carryed about with every wind of doctrine, by the ſleight of men, and cunning craftineſſe, whereby they lye in wait to deceive. But ſpeaking the truth in love, may grow up in him in all things, which is the head, even Chriſt: to whom with the Father, and the holy Ghoſt, three Perſons, but one onely wiſe God our Saviour, be all Glory, and Majeſtie, Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and Power, now and ever. AMEN.</p>
